## 摘要

**INTRODUCTION**  
The etiology of gender identity disorder (GID) remains largely unknown. In recent literature, increased attention has been attributed to possible biological factors in addition to psychological variables.

**AIM**  
To review the current literature on case studies of twins concordant or discordant for GID.

**METHODS**  
A systematic, comprehensive literature review.

**RESULTS**  
Of 23 monozygotic female and male twins, nine (39.1%) were concordant for GID; in contrast, none of the 21 same-sex dizygotic female and male twins were concordant for GID, a statistically significant difference (P=0.005). Of the seven opposite-sex twins, all were discordant for GID.

**CONCLUSIONS**  
These findings suggest a role for genetic factors in the development of GID.
