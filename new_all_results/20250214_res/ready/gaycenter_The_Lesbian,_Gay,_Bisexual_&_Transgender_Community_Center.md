## 引言

> “The Center introduced me to countless mentors who saw a light in me that I thought had gone out. I’ve been through many things, abuse, mental illness, and living in a homeless shelter. But through the guidance, leadership, and unwavering support of these mentors I met at The Center, I was able to become the version of myself I wanted to be.”
