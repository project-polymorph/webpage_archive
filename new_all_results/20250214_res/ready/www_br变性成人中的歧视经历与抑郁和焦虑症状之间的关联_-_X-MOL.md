### 目的
最近，人们越来越意识到韩国跨性别者所经历的社会耻辱和心理健康问题。为了提供定量证据，我们对跨性别成年人进行了一项全国性队列研究，这在亚洲尚属首次。该研究的目的是评估跨性别成年人抑郁和焦虑症状的患病率，并检查它们与歧视经历的关系。

### 方法
我们对 269 名韩国跨性别成年人进行了两波纵向调查，基线于 2020 年 10 月收集，随访于 2021 年 10 月。在过去 12 个月的随访中遭受歧视的经历被相应分类：经历过歧视的人(1) 没有，(2) 仅反跨性别歧视，(3) 仅其他类型的歧视，以及(4) 反跨性别和其他类型的歧视。使用流行病学研究中心抑郁量表测量抑郁症状，仅在随访时使用广泛性焦虑症 7 测量焦虑症状。我们使用改良的泊松回归来检查歧视经历与随访时心理健康结果之间的关联，并根据社会人口特征和基线抑郁症状进行调整。

### 结果
共有63.9%的人有抑郁症状，47.2%的人有焦虑症状。与没有经历过反跨性别歧视和其他类型歧视的参与者相比，经历过反跨性别歧视和其他类型歧视的参与者的抑郁和焦虑症状患病率分别高出 1.38 倍 (95% CI 1.06–1.81) 和 1.77 倍 (95% CI 1.16–2.70)。任何受到歧视的经历。

### 结论
为了促进跨性别者的心理健康，需要采取干预措施来减少对跨性别者的歧视。

### 英文标题与摘要
**Associations between discrimination experiences and symptoms of depression and anxiety among transgender adults: a nationwide cohort study of 269 transgender adults in South Korea**

### Purpose
Recently, there has been an increase in awareness of social stigma and mental health issues experienced by transgender individuals in South Korea. To provide quantitative evidence, we conducted a nationwide cohort study of transgender adults, first of its kind in Asia. The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and examine their associations with discrimination experiences among transgender adults.

### Methods
We conducted a two-wave longitudinal survey of 269 Korean transgender adults, where the baseline was collected in October 2020 and the follow-up in October 2021. Experiences of discrimination in the past 12 months at follow-up were categorized accordingly: those who experienced (1) none, (2) only anti-transgender discrimination, (3) only other types of discrimination, and (4) both anti-transgender and other types of discrimination. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale at both waves and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 only at follow-up. We used modified Poisson regression to examine the association between experiences of discrimination and mental health outcomes at follow-up and adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and baseline depressive symptoms.

### Results
A total of 63.9% had depressive symptoms and 47.2% had anxiety symptoms. Participants who experienced both anti-transgender and other types of discrimination had 1.38-times (95% CI 1.06–1.81) and 1.77-times (95% CI 1.16–2.70) higher prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, compared to those without any experiences of discrimination.

### Conclusions
Interventions to lessen discrimination towards transgender individuals are needed for the promotion of mental health among transgender individuals.
