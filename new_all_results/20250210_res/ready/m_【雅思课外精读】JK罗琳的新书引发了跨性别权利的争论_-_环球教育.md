《JK Rowling's new book sparks fresh transgender rights row》 罗琳的新书引发了跨性别权利的争论

JK Rowling has once again come under fire from transgender rights activists,this time for her new crime novel,which features a cross-dressing serial killer.由于JK罗琳的犯罪小说中描写了一个乔装成女人的连环杀手，她再次受到跨性别权利活动人士的攻击

1. Published Tuesday,"Troubled Blood"by Robert Galbraith--Rowling's crime writer pseudonym--is the fifth installment in the Cormoran Strike series.  
   罗琳的犯罪小说笔名是罗伯特加尔布雷斯，本周二出版的《Troubled Blood》是《侦探柯莫蓝·史崔克》系列小说的第五部。

2. An review of the novel in Britain's Daily Telegraph on Sunday described the"meat of the book"as an investigation into the cold case of a missing doctor who is believed to have fallen victim to a murderous cross-dresser.  
   周日，英国《每日邮报》评论称，这本书的核心就是一个医生被一个变装凶手杀害的故事。

3. "One wonders what critics of Rowling's stance on trans issues will make of a book whose moral seems to be:never trust a man in a dress,"reviewer Jake Kerridge wrote.  
   评论家杰克·凯瑞吉(Jake Kerridge)写道，“人们肯定想知道批评罗琳变性人立场的那些人回如何看待这本书，因为这本书似乎就是在说：永远不要相信那些穿着裙子的男人。”

4. Mermaids,a UK- based charity which supports transgender children and their families,said it was“concerned"by reports that the book features a character presenting as another gender in order to carry out attacks."This is a long-standing and somewhat tired trope,responsible for the demonization of a small group of people,simply hoping to live their lives with dignity,"a spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.The spokesperson cited an example from Rowling's second book in the"Strike"series from 2014--"The Silkworm,"which featured a transgender character as a suspect.  
   小说中出现了一个通过乔装为另一性别来实施袭击的角色，英国慈善机构美人鱼对此表示担忧，该机构致力于为跨性别儿童及其家庭提供帮助。该机构一位发言人告诉CNN，“这其实是一个长期存在又毫无新意的比喻，妖魔化了那一小部分人（变性群体），他们只是希望能够有尊严地生活。”这位发言人还谈及罗琳《侦探柯莫蓝·史崔克》系列的第二部《抽丝剥茧》。在这本书中，也将跨性别人士塑造成了嫌疑人。

5. "We are disappointed to hear that the author might be propagating the same,long-standing and hurtful presentation of trans women as a threat."As a children's charity,we are bearing witness to the very real hurt felt by young people who once saw Ms.Rowling's fiction as a place of comfort,friendship and escape.The author recently expressed support for trans people's right to live free from persecution.Her latest book might cause those still enjoying her books to question that sentiment,"the Mermaids statement added.Rowling's management told CNN that it would not be commenting on the latest controversy.  
   “知道罗琳还在传播这种由来已久的变性女性威胁论，我们很失望。”美人鱼的申明补充道，“很多年轻人都把罗琳的小说视为他们舒适和友谊的港湾，是他们心灵的栖息地，作为一个儿童慈善机构，我们目睹了罗琳这样的观点对这些年轻人切实的伤害。最近，罗琳表达了自己支持变性群体也有权免于迫害的观点，但是她的新书却让人们对此提出了质疑。”罗琳的经纪人告诉CNN记者，他们不对最近的争议发表评论。

6. Paris Lees,a transgender rights activist and British Vogue columnist,tweeted Monday:"JK Rowling's new book's about a'transvestite serial killer'Meanwhile over in the real world the number of trans people killed in Brazil has risen by 70%this past year,young trans women are left to burn in cars and men who kill us(for being trans)are pardoned and sent home."  
   帕里斯·利兹是一名跨性别人权活动家，同时也是一名时尚专栏作家，他周一称，“JK罗琳的新书讲的是一位异装连环杀手的故事。然而，在现实世界中，今年，巴西变性人士死亡人数上升了70%，那些年轻的变性女性被烧死在汽车里，而那些杀人的男人却获得赦免，获准回家。”

7. Likening Rowling to her own creation of the much-disliked"Harry Potter"character Dolores Umbridge,trans actress and writer Jen Richards said on Twitter that the author has become so"obsessed with her deeply prejudiced perspective that she'll go to any length to remain convinced of her own righteousness,no matter what harm it causes."  
   变性演员兼作家珍·理查兹将罗琳比作多洛雷斯·乌姆里奇，这是罗琳《哈利波特》系列小说中最让人讨厌的角色，珍·理查兹在推特上说，罗琳“对自己的那些偏见深信不疑，她坚信自己所谓的正义，却从不管这些正义会带来什么后果。”

8. Rowling's comments and views on gender have made headlines several times this year.Last month,the author said she would be handing back a prestigious human rights award after Kerry Kennedy,president of the Robert F.Kennedy Human Rights organization,said Rowling's viewpoint"diminishes the identity"of transgender people.In June,Rowling sparked controversy after mocking a headline about"people who menstruate." "'People who menstruate.' I'm sure there used to be a word for those people,"she tweeted."Someone help me out.Wumben?Wimpund?Woomud?"  
   今年，罗琳关于性别的评论和观点多次登上新闻头条。上个月，在罗伯特·F·肯尼迪人权组织主席克里·肯尼迪批评罗琳的观点贬低了跨性别者的身份之后，罗琳表示她将会归还该组织颁发给她的人权奖。今年6月，罗琳还嘲讽了一个“来月经人群”的标题，她说‘来月经的人’，我敢肯定，以前有一个词可以形容这些人。谁来帮帮我？这个词是Wumben？Wimpund？还是Woomud？”

9. Her comments led actors who starred in film adaptations of her books to disagree with her.Among them were Daniel Radcliffe,Emma Watson and Eddie Redmayne of the"Harry Potter"movie series."Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told that they aren't who they say they are,"Watson wrote.  
   她的这些言论遭到了那些曾出演她小说改编的电影的演员们的反对，其中包括出演《哈利波特》系列电影的丹尼尔·雷德克里夫、艾玛·沃特森和埃迪·雷德梅尼。沃特森写道:“变性人就是变性人，他们应该过自己的生活，而不是一直被质疑，她们也不该一直被纠正说她们的性别认知出现了问题。”

10. Following the reaction,Rowling published an essay about gender identity on her website and explained why she chose to share her views."All I'm asking--all I want--is for similar empathy,similar understanding,to be extended to the many millions of women whose sole crime is wanting their concerns to be heard without receiving threats and abuse,"Rowling said.  
    作为回应，罗琳在她的网站上发表了一篇关于性别身份的文章，解释了她为什么要将自己的观点公开。“我所要求的，我想要的，不过就是我们的同理心，我们的理解能够延伸到千百万女性的身上，她们唯一的希望就是自己的声音能被听到，而不是不断受到威胁和虐待。”

11. In her nearly 3,700-word essay,Rowling explained how her own experiences influenced her view,disclosing that she is a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor.  
    在她这篇近3700字的文章中，罗琳称她自己的经历影响了她的观点，透露她曾是一个家庭暴力和性侵犯的受害者。
