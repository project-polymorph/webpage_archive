本文使用了2015年美国27,715名跨性别受访者的跨性别调查，研究了少数民族性别认同状况与收入、就业和贫困率之间的关系。与《美国社区调查》中的男性相比，所有跨性别人群的收入明显较低，并且更有可能处于贫困、失业或兼职的状态。在跨性别样本中，出生时被分配为女性的人的收入明显较低，并且比出生时被分配为男性的人更有可能从事兼职工作。这些收入结果对受访者的社会过渡程度非常敏感。跨性别者越年轻，“通过”的能力越强，他们的收入状况就越能反映出性别身份，而不是出生时所分配的性别。

**The Labour Market Outcomes of Transgender Individuals**

This paper uses the 2015 United States Transgender Survey of 27,715 transgender respondents to study the relationship between minority gender identity status and income, employment, and poverty rates. All transgender groups have significantly lower incomes and are more likely to be in poverty, unemployed or working part-time, when compared with men in the American Community Survey. Within the transgender sample, those who were assigned female at birth have significantly lower incomes and are more likely to work part-time than those assigned male at birth. These income results are sensitive to the degree to which respondents have socially transitioned. The younger transgender people transition and the greater their ability to ‘pass’, the more their income profiles reflect that of their gender identity rather than the sex they were assigned at birth. Together, these findings provide descriptive evidence in support of a traditional cisgender income gap, with ‘maleness’ being associated with an income premium in the workplace over ‘femaleness’.
