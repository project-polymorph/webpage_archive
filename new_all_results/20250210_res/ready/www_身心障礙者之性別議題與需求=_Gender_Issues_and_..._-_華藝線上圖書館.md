### 摘要

身心障礙者在特殊性別需求上具有複雜的性別議題，尤其是女性身心障礙者在生殖健康、性別暴力和慢性病管理上所遭遇的諸多挑戰，也會因交通不便和經濟困難，難以獲得持續的慢性病照護與管理。男性身心障礙者則在心理健康和事故預防方面需求較高，社會期望和性別角色壓力使他們難以尋求心理支持。跨性別身心障礙者在性別確認治療上面臨複雜需求，且在醫療機構中經常遭遇歧視和不理解。醫療機構可加強對醫療工作者進行性別意識，以提升包容性和服務品質。因此，需要從各層面加強對身心障礙者特殊性別健康需求，提供性別敏感性的培訓課程，並建立有效的支持機制，包括性別暴力防治措施和心理支持服務，以確保身心障礙者特殊性別議題中，獲得平等權利和安全福祉。

### 平行摘要

Individuals with disabilities often face complex gender-related problems because of their special needs. In particular, women with disabilities often face many challenges pertaining to reproductive health, gender-based violence, and chronic disease management. In addition, transportation difficulties and financial constraints further hinder their access to continuous chronic disease care and management. Compared with women, men with disabilities have higher needs for mental health and accident prevention; however, social expectations and gender role pressure often deter such men from seeking psychological support. Transgender individuals with disabilities have complex requirements related to gender-affirming treatment and often face discrimination and misunderstanding in medical settings. To solve this problem, medical institutions should enhance gender awareness among their medical personnel to promote inclusivity and improve service quality. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the focus on the specific gender health needs of individuals with disabilities from various aspects. This includes providing gender-sensitive training courses, and establishing effective support mechanisms, such as measures to prevent gender-based violence prevention and offering psychological support services. These efforts are essential to ensure that individuals with disabilities receive equal rights and safety in addressing their unique gender issues.
