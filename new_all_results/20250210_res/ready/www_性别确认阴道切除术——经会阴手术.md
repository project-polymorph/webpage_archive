### 客观的
性别确认阴道切除术可治疗跨性别男性因阴道存在而引起的性别不安。先前报道的方法包括经会阴阴道切除术、粘膜电灼术和机器人辅助。我们介绍了一名39岁跨性别男性经会阴性别肯定阴道切除术的关键步骤。

### 方法
已获得视频录制的知情同意。患者在6个月前接受了第一阶段阴茎成形术。他被安置在高位截石特雷德伦贝格位置。Foley放置后，沿皮肤粘膜交界处横向和后部切开一个切口。切开前沟并在膀胱颈前面制作横向切口。切除阴道粘膜，保留远端阴道前壁粘膜，稍后将其作为皮瓣移动以用于尿道延长。从顶端开始用一系列荷包缝合线封闭阴道旁空间。阴道前壁瓣的根部位于尿道口处。膀胱镜检查证实输尿管通畅并且没有下尿路受累。放置耻骨上管。然后进行第二阶段阴茎成形术，包括尿道延长和阴囊成形术。

### 结果
演示过程耗时110分钟，估计失血量为75毫升。在我们发表的40例阴道切除术系列中，包括27例阴茎成形术和13例阴蒂成形术，中位手术时间为135分钟，中位估计失血量为250cc。未发生与阴道切除术相关的并发症，包括粘液囊肿、阴道瘘或内脏损伤。44%的病例发生腹膜进入，并且主要闭合，没有进一步的后遗症。两名患者需要输血，一名患者患有艰难梭菌结肠炎。83%的情况下阴道前壁粘膜瓣被合并。

### 结论
经会阴阴道切除术的围手术期并发症较低，学习曲线后大约需要2小时。我们之前已经报道了一系列这些程序的详细结果。

### English Abstract
**Gender-affirming Vaginectomy–Transperineal Approach**

**OBJECTIVE**  
Gender-affirming vaginectomy treats gender dysphoria associated with the presence of a vagina in transgender males. Prior reported approaches include transperineal vaginectomy, mucosal fulguration, and robotic-assisted. We present key steps in transperineal gender-affirming vaginectomy in a 39-year-old transgender male.

**METHODS**  
Informed consent for video recording was obtained. The patient underwent a first-stage phalloplasty 6 months prior. He was placed in high lithotomy Tredelenberg position. After Foley placement, an incision was made along the mucocutaneous junction laterally and posteriorly. The anterior sulci were incised and a transverse incision made anteriorly at the bladder neck. The vaginal mucosa was excised, except for the distal anterior vaginal wall mucosa which would be mobilized as a flap for urethral lengthening later. The paravaginal space was closed with a series of purse-string sutures starting at the apex. The anterior vaginal wall flap is mobilized with the base of the flap at the urethral meatus. Cystoscopy confirms ureteral patency and no lower urinary tract involvement. A suprapubic tube was placed. The procedure then proceeded with a second-stage phalloplasty that included urethral lengthening and scrotoplasty.

**RESULTS**  
The demonstrated procedure took 110 minutes and estimated blood loss was 75 mL. In our published series of 40 vaginectomies for 27 phalloplasties and 13 metoidioplasties, median operative time was 135 minutes and median estimated blood loss was 250cc. No complications related to the vaginectomy, including mucocele, fistulae to the vaginal space, or visceral injuries occurred. Peritoneal entry occurred in 44% of the cases and was closed primarily without further sequelae. Two patients required blood transfusion and 1 patient had C. difficile colitis. The anterior vaginal wall mucosa flap was incorporated in 83% of the time.

**CONCLUSION**  
Transperineal vaginectomy results in low periprocedural complications, takes approximately 2 hours after a learning curve. Detailed results from our series of these procedures have been previously reported.
