# Advocates for Trans Equality | Fighting for legal and political rights of transgender people in America

## About us

Leveraging decades of experience on the frontlines of power, we shift government and society towards a future where we are no less than equal. A4TE was founded in 2024 as the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) and Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund (TLDEF), two long-time champions for the trans community, merged together as one organization. A4TE builds on their successes to boldly imagine a world where trans people live our lives joyfully and without barriers.

## What We Do

Our policy experts, litigators, and community organizers work at all levels of government to ensure trans voices are not only heard, but embraced in rooms where they've long been ignored. As a trans-led nonprofit, we also help our community navigate the realities of law and policy through vital tools, knowledge, and services.

## Issues

Whether youâ€™re looking for gender-affirming support, or ways to protect trans rights, Advocates for Trans Equality has the right resource for you. Through our ID Documents Center, we support trans people with changing their name and/or gender marker on official documents. If you are transgender, gender non-conforming, or nonbinary living with a low income, we offer pro bono legal name change services through our Name Change Project. Through our Trans Health Project, we expand access to medical care for trans people through litigation and public education. We also provide real data about what it means to be trans in America to help inform policymakers, educators, healthcare providers, and others via our U.S. Trans Survey, the largest survey ever of trans people in the United States. Looking for more ways to affirm and protect trans lives in your state? Visit our State Action Center.
