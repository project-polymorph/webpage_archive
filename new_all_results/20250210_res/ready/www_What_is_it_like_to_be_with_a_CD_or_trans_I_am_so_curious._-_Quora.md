I am an intersexed transgender man. I enjoy answering questions on this subject, so here goes. First of all, it isn’t a choice. It’s just what and who we are inside. We feel as though our bodies and mind don’t match up. We may have a female body, but our brains are male, and vice versa. We want to match them up so we can be at peace with ourselves. It’s possible for us to be gay or straight or any other orientation. That is not what defines us as trans—that is sexual orientation, not gender orientation. We usually want desperately to change our bodies to match our minds or souls, if you will. We usually know from young childhood that we are another gender. I did, at age 4. To be with one of us is really no different than any other person. You just have to understand that what you see is not quite what you get. You might be with a transman who looks a bit feminine but still uses the men's room. Or vice versa. We ask that you treat us just like anyone else. You use our new names and pronouns. You don’t call us negative things or joke about our being trans. You respect us and our state of transition. We in return should do the same for you. Feel free to ask further questions, especially of me. I am very comfortable with this subject and am a retired college professor. Thanks for the question, btw.

> Some people see relationships with crossdressers or trans individuals pretty much like any other relationship, while others think there are some unique factors at play.

**Similarities to Other Relationships:**
- Shared Interests and Values:
- Emotional Intimacy:
- Physical Intimacy:

**Unique Aspects:**
- Gender Identity and Expression: Partners might have different views and experiences about gender.
- Communication: It’s often important for couples to develop specific ways of talking about things related to gender and personal identities.
- Societal Challenges: They may face some judgment or misunderstanding from others.

Ultimately, how you feel about Transgirls really depends on what you’re into.

**Advantages:**
- They usually won’t constantly ask for shopping trips or expensive gifts.
- Their open-mindedness means they often go the extra mile to make their partners happy.
- They’re easy to talk to and tend to have fewer mood swings.
- Trustworthiness is a plus; cheating isn’t typically their thing.
- Their love for makeup means they often look amazing, like Hollywood stars.

**Disadvantages:**
- Traditional family structures might not be a thing for them.
- Sometimes, they may show a little masculine side.
- They've made changes to appeal to both men and women, which can complicate their identities.

I’ve shared some info about meeting Tgirls, but having a chat or meeting one could really help you figure out what you connect with.

I've been with 2 transwomen in my life and they were beautiful women in every way. As a lifelong lesbian I had never had sex with anyone that had a penis until I met my first trans girlfriend at 28 and losing my virginity to her. The sex was by far the best lesbian sex I've ever had and the feeling of her ejaculating into me was indescribable. I now prefer sex with girls that have penises over sex with girls that have vaginas because of this experience.

When the OP says CD (crossdresser?) and trans (trans what? transsexual, transgender, transvestite, transgenderist, transman, transperson, transfag, transdyke, tranny, transboy, transgirl, trannyqueer, even transphobe, each means somewhat different things), we are talking about a very wide range of gender constructs, behaviors and identities. Probably a much wider diversity than those that fit under the category of cisgender.

As such, there is absolutely no single experience. And I am certainly not qualified to speak for this absolutely fantastic range of experiences.

But I can speak for myself. I use the label transgender because it is a nice umbrella term that includes all the labels above (ok, not transphobe) plus hundreds of other labels. I don’t like being boxed into a narrow label or definition. But to be more specific, for the last 40 years I have been living both as a man and a woman, switching between the two genders as my needs and situation called for. Heck, I’ve even had different careers based on my genders for as a physicist, the masculine role has worked well, but as an artist, I have found my feminine role fits better.

As you might guess from the above, I absolutely love being transgender. Each gender is a totally different life experience, and given that we are only on this planet a short time, I find it absolutely fantastic that I have been able to live my life encompassing both major human experiences.

These kind of questions objectify someone. It’s not about the person they are, but what they are. If it’s the latter,,, please pay someone. If it’s about the former then get to know a person.

Why do you want to?

CD = part time… usually sexual.

Trans = usually about identity of who they are.

The point being they may look the same but the driving engine is very different.

I would say that many of us are more empathetic to a male partner as we’ve been in some ways in that place. Of course we cannot give a partner babies yet, so back to the first question.
