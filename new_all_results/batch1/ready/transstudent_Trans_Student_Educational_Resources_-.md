Trans Student Educational Resources is a youth-led organization dedicated to transforming the educational environment for trans and gender non-conforming students through advocacy and empowerment. Founded in 2011, it is the only national organization led by trans youth.

In addition to our focus on creating a more trans-friendly education system, our mission is to educate the public and teach trans activists how to be effective organizers. We believe that justice for trans and gender nonconforming youth is contingent on an intersectional framework of activism. Ending oppression is a long-term process that can only be achieved through collaborative action.

We [speak at conferences](https://transstudent.org/workshops), train teachers, collaborate with other advocacy organizations, organize the only national [Trans Youth Leadership Summit](https://transstudent.org/tyls), support trans-related events, [provide leadership training for trans youth](https://transstudent.org/volunteer), host [scholarships](https://transstudent.org/scholarships) for trans students, publish [materials about trans education](https://transstudent.org/graphics), help [create transgender-supportive policies](https://transstudent.org/policy), and [promote trans representation in media.](https://transstudent.org/press/news/)

Check out our new limited-edition shirts! Shirts are available in sizes S-2XL. Funds will go towards TSER’s capacity as we continue to hire trans youth and restart our scholarship program for trans students. We intend on providing as many scholarships as possible during this unprecedented time so we appreciate your support! These scholarships will fill in a huge gap facing transgender scholars, as there are currently no other national scholarship programs specifically for trans students.
