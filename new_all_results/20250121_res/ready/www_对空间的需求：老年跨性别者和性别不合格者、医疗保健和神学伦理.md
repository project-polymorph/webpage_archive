跨性别者、性别不合格者和老年人的知名度正在提高；然而，迄今为止，很少考虑这两个群体的重叠。因此，在老年人的护理和医疗方面，跨性别者在很大程度上仍然是隐形的。这个群体面临的歧视至少是双重的：他们是变性恐惧症和年龄歧视煽动的攻击目标。尽管年长的跨性别者和性别不合格者作为另一个已经边缘化的群体中的一个被严重边缘化的群体而存在，但即使是神学伦理领域也忽视了给予他们伦理上的关注。由于老年跨性别者和性别不合格者的特殊脆弱性，这会给他们带来特别严重的后果。有报告称，由于经常在医疗机构中经历跨性别恐惧症，跨性别者决定不再使用医疗服务。在这种情况下，跨性别者和性别不合格问题中存在宗教成分，不应被忽视。一方面，医务人员以基督教信仰为名，拒绝为跨性别者提供基本医疗服务。另一方面，对可见性场所和个人空间的要求，经常在跨性别研究中提出，并且可以与神学伦理中关于给予空间的讨论联系起来。希伯来和基督教传统中的一些伦理准则侧重于创造其他生物可以存在的空间，如兄弟姐妹、友谊和安息日等概念中所见。通过了解老年跨性别者和性别不合格者及其对空间的需求，通过对空间创造的伦理概念的反思，本研究对老年跨性别者的空间形成了具体的理解。本文旨在加深对神学伦理学和应用伦理学中跨积极空间的理解。所有那些以前因无知、蔑视或暴力而占据跨性别空间的人都会撤退或收缩的空间，不应因此而成为缺席的空间：事实上，老年跨性别者和性别不合格者可能需要这两种空间，那些因差异而导致退缩的人，以及那些让他人继续提供帮助的人。

**Demand for Space: Elderly Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People, Healthcare, and Theological Ethics**

Visibility for transgender and gender nonconforming people and the elderly is growing; however, thus far the overlap of the two groups has rarely been considered. Trans persons therefore remain largely invisible in the context of older people’s care and medicine. The discrimination faced by this group is at least twofold: they are the targets of aggression incited by transphobia, and also by ageism. Although older trans and gender nonconforming people exist as a greatly marginalized group within another already marginalized group, even the field of theological ethics has neglected to grant them ethical attention. This leads to especially harsh consequences for elderly transgender and gender nonconforming people due to their specific vulnerabilities. There are reports from trans persons who have resolved never to make use of health services again due to regular experiences of transphobia in medical settings. There are religious components within transgender and gender nonconforming issues that should not be overlooked in this context. On the one hand, medical staff, in the name of their Christian beliefs, have refused to provide trans persons with basic medical care. On the other hand, demands for places of visibility, and spaces for the individual, are regularly made in trans-positive studies, and can be linked to discussions within theological ethics about giving space. Some ethical formulas within the Hebrew and Christian traditions focus on the creation of space in which other beings may exist, as found in concepts like brother–sisterhood, friendship, and Sabbath. By casting light on elderly trans and gender nonconforming people, and on their demands for space, via reflections on ethical concepts of space-making, this study develops a specific understanding of space for elderly trans persons. The paper aims to develop an understanding of trans-positive spaces within theological ethics and applied ethics. Spaces that assume a withdrawal or contraction by all those who have previously taken up trans spaces through ignorance, contempt, or violence, should not thereby become spaces of absence: indeed, elderly trans and gender nonconforming people might be in need of both kinds of spaces, those where otherness enables withdrawal, and those where the helping presence of others continues.
