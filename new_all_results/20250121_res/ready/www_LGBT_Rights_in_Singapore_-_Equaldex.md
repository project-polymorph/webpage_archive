### Right to change legal gender in Singapore

In [1996](/timeline/1996 "1996 Timeline of LGBT Rights"), Member of Parliament (MP) Abdullah Tarmugi made an announcement that individuals who have undergone surgery could marry someone of the opposite sex.

**Current status**

Legal, but restricted for minors

Trans youths with both parents’ consent can access HRT through private healthcare if they are above 16, and through public healthcare if they are above 18. HRT approval for trans youths under 21 is much stricter, especially given the global climate surrounding transitioning for trans youths. You will be subject to significantly more evaluation than trans adults, and some individuals have been rejected for HRT despite having consent from both parents.
