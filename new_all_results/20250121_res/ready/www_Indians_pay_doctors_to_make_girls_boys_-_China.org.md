Indian doctors have been accused of conducting sex change operations on young girls whose parents want a son to improve the family's income prospects, the _Daily Telegraph_ reported.

Madhya Pradesh state government is investigating claims that up to 300 girls were surgically turned into boys in one city after their parents paid about £2,000 each for the operations.

There are now 7 million more boys than girls under 6 in the country.
