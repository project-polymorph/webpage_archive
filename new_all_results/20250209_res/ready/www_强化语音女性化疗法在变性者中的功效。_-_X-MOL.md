研究表明，跨性别的年轻罪犯是一个独特的弱势案例，可以通过言语病理干预来帮助他们使自己的声音与性别认同保持一致。但是，以前没有研究调查该人群的治疗效果。这项研究调查了针对青少年司法机构内一名17岁跨性别者的针对基本频率和口腔共振的强化语音女性化疗法的影响。声音分析，声音女性气质的聆听者和自我评价，声音满意度的自我评价，治疗后结构化访谈以及变性语音调查表（TVQ MtF）的治疗前后）用于确定治疗效果。结果指标表明，治疗可有效提高患者的嗓音和女性气质，而不会影响嗓音质量。然而，客户仍然没有被一致认为是女性干预后的女性，并且在话语中难以实施女性语言策略。该案例研究为强化语音女性化疗法在青少年犯罪人群中的有效性提供了初步证据。这项研究还强调了即使在进行干预的时间有限的情况下，言语病理学家在青年司法环境中工作的潜在效用。此外，本研究论文验证了在跨性别语音工作中使用感知结果测量方法，

**Efficacy of intensive voice feminisation therapy in a transgender young offender.**

Research suggests that transgender young offenders are a uniquely vulnerable caseload that may benefit from speech pathology intervention to help bring their voice into alignment with their gender identity. However, no previous studies have investigated treatment efficacy in this population. This study investigated the impact of intensive voice feminisation therapy targeting fundamental frequency and oral resonance in a 17 year old transgender individual within a youth justice institution. Acoustic analysis, listener and self-ratings of vocal femininity, self-ratings of vocal satisfaction, a post-treatment structured interview, and pre- and post- treatment completion of the Transsexual Voice Questionnaire (TVQMtF) were utilised to determine treatment impact. Outcome measures indicated therapy was effective at increasing the client’s vocal pitch and perceptually femininity without compromising vocal quality. However, the client was still not consistently perceived as female post-intervention and had difficulty implementing feminine speech strategies in discourse. This case study provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of intensive voice feminisation therapy in a youth offending population. This research also highlights the potential utility of speech pathologists working in youth justice settings, even when the timeframe for intervention is limited. Furthermore, this research paper validates the use of perceptual outcome measures in transgender voice work, by replicating previous findings in which significant correlations were found between perceptual ratings of vocal gender and client satisfaction.
