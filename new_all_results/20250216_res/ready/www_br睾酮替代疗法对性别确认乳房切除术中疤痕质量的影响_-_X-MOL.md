### 摘要

跨性别者一词是指感觉到自己的性别认同与出生时分配给他们的性别不一致的人。一些跨性别者接受激素治疗，这可能会导致特定的皮肤状况。本研究的目的是确定激素治疗（特别是睾酮治疗）与不满意的手术疤痕（包括增生性和瘢痕疙瘩）之间是否存在因果关系。此外，这项研究可以作为未来研究的基础，未来研究可能会测试旨在减少此类不良影响的手段。在这项回顾性观察性队列研究中，收集了 170 名患者的数据，这些患者在 2003 年至 2021 年期间由资深作者接受了乳房切除术作为性别确认手术。对医疗记录进行分析，从患者的医疗档案中获得个人、医疗（包括睾酮治疗的持续时间）和手术信息。盲法评估者通过审查患者的术后临床图片来评估手术疤痕。使用经过验证的 Stony Brook 疤痕评估量表（SBSES）对疤痕进行评级。SBSES 的验证研究中描述了使用图片评估手术疤痕，因此被接受。总共 63 例患者被纳入睾酮组，63 例被纳入非睾酮治疗组。SBSES 评分的平均分分别为 2.74 和 2.66。两个平均值之间的差异没有统计学意义。在我们的回顾性队列研究中，我们没有发现睾酮治疗对术后手术疤痕的影响显著。

**Effect of testosterone replacement therapy on scar quality in gender-affirming mastectomies**  
The term transgenders refer to people who sense discordance between their gender identity and the sex assigned to them at birth. Some transgenders receive hormonal therapy, which may lead to specific skin conditions. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether a causal relationship exists between hormonal therapy (specifically testosterone therapy) and unsatisfying surgical scarring, including hypertrophic and keloid scars. In addition, this study may serve as a basis for future studies, which may test means that aim to reduce such undesired effects. In this retrospective, observational cohort study, data were collected regarding 170 patients who underwent mastectomy as a gender-affirming surgery by the senior author between 2003 and 2021. The medical records were analysed to obtain personal, medical (including the duration of testosterone treatment) and surgical information from the patients’ medical files. A blinded evaluator assessed the surgical scars by reviewing the postoperative clinical pictures of the patients. The scars were rated using the validated Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale (SBSES). The use of pictures to assess surgical scars is described in the validation study of the SBSES and is, therefore, accepted. In total, 63 patients were included in the testosterone group and 63 were included in the non-testosterone treated group. The averages of the SBSES score were 2.74 and 2.66, respectively. The difference between the two averages was not statistically significant. In our retrospective cohort study, we did not find the effect of testosterone therapy on post-operative surgical scars to be significant.
