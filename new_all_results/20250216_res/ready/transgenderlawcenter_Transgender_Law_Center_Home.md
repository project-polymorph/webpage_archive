# Transgender Law Center

Transgender Law Center is the largest national trans-led organization advocating self-determination for all people. Since 2002 we’ve been organizing, assisting, informing and empowering thousands of individual community members towards a long-term, national, trans-led movement for liberation.

Transgender people living with HIV are capable of forming our own network, telling our own stories, and developing our own advocacy strategies – and TLC’s Positively Trans program is the proof.

## Get Help

From employment and housing discrimination to criminalization and violence, transgender people are often forced to engage with a legal system that wasn’t built for us. Even something as basic as correcting our identity documents to reflect who we truly are can be a confusing, overwhelming, and isolating process.

By maintaining a robust collection of resources and publications, TLC does our best to guide you through some of the more common legal challenges and questions transgender people encounter. If you can’t find an answer in our publications, our Legal Information Helpdesk is here to respond to your questions and refer you to other resources and members of our pro bono network for support.

## Legal

TLC has a long history of victories for the trans movement, from winning rights for trans workers nationwide in _Macy v. Holder_ (EEOC 2012) to the first federal appellate court decision protecting trans students under federal statutory and constitutional law in _Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified School District_ (7th Cir. 2017).
