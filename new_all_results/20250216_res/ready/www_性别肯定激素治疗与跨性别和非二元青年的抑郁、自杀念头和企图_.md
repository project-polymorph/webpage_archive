### 目的
没有大规模研究检查接受性别肯定激素治疗 (GAHT) 的跨性别和非二元青年的心理健康。本研究的目的是在大量跨性别和非二元青年样本中检查获得 GAHT 与抑郁、自杀念头和自杀未遂之间的关联。

### 方法
数据是作为 2020 年对 34,759 名 13-24 岁的女同性恋、男同性恋、双性恋、跨性别、酷儿和质疑青年进行调查的一部分收集的，其中包括 11,914 名跨性别或非二元青年。调整后的逻辑回归评估了接受 GAHT 是否与想要接受 GAHT 的人的抑郁、自杀念头和自杀未遂水平降低相关。

### 结果
一半的跨性别和非二元青年表示他们没有使用 GAHT，但愿意使用，36% 对接受 GAHT 不感兴趣，14% 正在接受 GAHT。父母对孩子性别认同的支持与接受 GAHT 有密切关系，近 80% 接受 GAHT 的人报告说，他们至少有一位父母支持他们的性别认同。与那些想要 GAHT 但没有收到的相比，GAHT 与近期抑郁症 (aOR = .61, _p_ < .01) 和过去一年自杀未遂 (aOR = .62, _p_< .05) 相关。

### 结论
研究结果支持获得 GAHT 与跨性别和非二元青年的抑郁和自杀率降低之间的关系。

**Association of Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy With Depression, Thoughts of Suicide, and Attempted Suicide Among Transgender and Nonbinary Youth**

### Purpose
There are no large-scale studies examining mental health among transgender and nonbinary youth who receive gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). The purpose of this study is to examine associations among access to GAHT with depression, thoughts of suicide, and attempted suicide among a large sample of transgender and nonbinary youth.

### Methods
Data were collected as part of a 2020 survey of 34,759 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning youth aged 13–24, including 11,914 transgender or nonbinary youth. Adjusted logistic regression assessed whether receipt of GAHT was associated with lower levels of depression, thoughts of suicide, and attempted suicide among those who wanted to receive GAHT.

### Results
Half of transgender and nonbinary youth said they were not using GAHT but would like to, 36% were not interested in receiving GAHT, and 14% were receiving GAHT. Parent support for their child's gender identity had a strong relationship with receipt of GAHT, with nearly 80% of those who received GAHT reporting they had at least one parent who supported their gender identity. Use of GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent depression (adjusted odds ratio \[aOR\] = .73, _p_ < .001) and seriously considering suicide (aOR = .74, _p_ < .001) compared to those who wanted GAHT but did not receive it. For youth under age 18, GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent depression (aOR = .61, _p_ < .01) and of a past-year suicide attempt (aOR = .62, _p_ < .05).

### Conclusions
Findings support a relationship between access to GAHT and lower rates of depression and suicidality among transgender and nonbinary youth.
