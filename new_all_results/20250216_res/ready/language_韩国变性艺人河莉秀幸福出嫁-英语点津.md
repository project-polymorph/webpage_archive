South Korean **transgender beauty** Harisu **tied the knot** in Seoul Saturday with her boyfriend singer, pledging to become a "sexy and caring" wife.

Harisu, 32, married 27-year-old **rap singer** Micky Chung in an upmarket hotel in Seoul. She has been dating the singer since 2005 after they met online.

The marriage ceremony was carried out by Kim Suk-Kwon, a surgeon who performed Harisu's **male-to-female sex reassignment surgery** in late 1990s.

"I'll become a housewife who is cooking well, sexy and caring," a beaming Harisu told journalists before the wedding ceremony.

"We originally planned to adopt 10 children but decided to settle for only four kids because of the objections from our parents," she said.

Accompanied by both sets of parents, they will leave for the Thai resort island of Koh Samui on Sunday for a honeymoon.

Harisu is the stage name of the transgender entertainer who was born Lee Kyung-Yup.

She made her name by featuring in an advertisement for a cosmetics company in 2001.

She has since branched out into music and acting, producing five albums and starring in a film, Yellow Hair II.

In December 2002, the Incheon District Court recognised her as legally female and she changed her official name to Lee Kyung-Eun.
