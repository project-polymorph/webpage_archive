# 跨性别女性激素治疗的研究综述

## 摘要

### 研究背景

性别焦虑症被描述为基于第一或第二性征的个体经历或表达性别与其原具有性别之间的不匹配。性别焦虑症可能与临床上重要的心理困扰有关，并可能导致改变性特征的需求。改变一个人的性特征以适应其所需性别的过程称为“转换”。

目前的指南建议使用激素和手术干预（如需要）来帮助跨性别女性（即目标为从男性过渡到女性的人）的转换。在成人中，激素疗法旨在逆转身体的男性属性并促进女性属性的发展。它通常包括雌二醇、抗雄激素或两者的组合。许多人首先单独接受激素治疗，而没有进行手术干预。然而，这并不总是足够以根据需要改变诸如面部骨骼结构、乳房和生殖器等属性。对于这些跨性别女性，可以通过手术促进转换。

### 研究目的

本综述旨在评价与其他治疗方法或安慰剂治疗相比，使用抗雄激素、雌二醇或两者进行激素治疗对于跨性别女性转换的有效性和安全性。

### 检索策略

研究检索了MEDLINE、Cochrane对照试验中心注册库（Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL）、Embase、Biosis Preview、PsycINFO和PSYNDEX。我们于2019年12月19日进行了最终检索。

### 纳入排除标准

本综述纳入研究的标准是基于16岁及以上从男性过渡到女性的跨性别女性进行的随机对照试验（randomised controlled trials, RCT）、准RCT和队列研究。与另一种形式的主动干预或安慰剂治疗对照相比，符合条件的研究评价了单独或联合使用抗雄激素和雌二醇疗法。

### 资料收集与分析

我们采用了Cochrane推荐的标准方法学程序确定研究是否具有纳入资格。

### 主要结果

我们通过数据库检索到了1057篇参考文献，在删除重复项后，我们筛选了其中的787篇。我们在全文筛选阶段检查了13项研究的纳入资格。我们排除了12项研究，并确定其中一项为正在进行的研究。我们没有检索到任何符合纳入标准的、已完成的研究。本项正在进行的研究是一项在泰国进行的比较戊酸雌二醇加环丙孕酮治疗与戊酸雌二醇加螺内酯治疗的研究。主要结局将是三个月随访时的睾酮水平。

### 作者结论

我们未找到足够的证据来确定激素治疗方法对转换期跨性别女性的有效性或安全性。研究的缺乏表明当前的临床实践和临床研究之间存在差距。需要稳健的RCT和对照队列研究来评价激素疗法（单独使用或联合使用）对转换期跨性别女性的益处和伤害。研究应特别关注受试者短期、中期和长期不良反应、生活质量及其对单独或联合使用抗雄激素和雌二醇治疗下其身体特征从男性到女性变化的满意度。研究还应关注此类激素在口服、透皮和肌肉注射时的相对作用。我们将在本综述的下一次迭代中纳入非对照队列研究，因为本综述表明此类研究能够提供该领域目前可获取的最高质量证据。届时我们将考虑其方法论局限。

## 简语概要

### 激素疗法是否有助于跨性别女性进行性别重建以实现转换？

**研究背景**

跨性别女性可能会认为她们天生具有错误的性特征。这可能会导致严重的心理困扰（性别焦虑），她们希望改变自身男性身体和性特征，以符合她们经历过的女性性别。这是一个称为转换的过程。如果不采取帮助转换的措施，可能会导致跨性别女性心理压力更大。用于帮助具有男性身体的跨性别女性实现转换的医学治疗方法之一是合成女性荷尔蒙。这些激素可以通过口服、皮肤吸收或肌肉注射摄入。

**研究特征**

我们寻找纳入从男性向女性转换的跨性别女性（16岁及以上）的随机对照试验（randomised controlled trials, RCT）。RCT是一种能够降低几类偏倚可能性的研究方法。本综述纳入研究的标准是比较用于促进跨性别女性转换的不同激素治疗（单独使用雌激素、单独使用睾酮阻滞剂或雌激素联合睾酮阻滞剂），或比较该类激素治疗与安慰剂治疗（看似与实际治疗相同但不具有医疗效果的假治疗）。我们希望看到激素治疗是否有助于跨性别女性实现令她们满意的转换。我们还希望看到治疗是否存在任何健康风险。

**关键结果**

我们检索了截至2019年12月19日的研究。我们无法找到任何可以纳入的相关已完成研究。我们确实发现了一项正在进行的研究，该研究计划在2020年年底前招募所有参与研究的人。本研究比较了戊酸雌二醇加环丙孕酮治疗与戊酸雌二醇加螺内酯治疗对泰国跨性别女性的影响。

**证据质量**

我们未检索到研究激素疗法用于帮助跨性别女性转换时是否有效和安全的RCT。因此，需要高质量RCT对此类问题进行研究。

## Resumen visual

## Authors' conclusions

### Implications for practice

We found insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy or safety of hormonal treatment approaches (estradiol alone or in combination with cyproterone acetate or spironolactone) for transgender women in transition. The evidence is very incomplete, demonstrating a gap between current clinical practice and clinical research.

### Implications for research

This systematic review has shown that well‐designed, sufficiently robust randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled‐cohort studies do not exist, and are needed, to assess the benefits and harms of hormone therapies (used alone or in combination) for transgender women in transition. The following questions should be addressed via RCTs and cohort studies:

1.  What are the short‐, medium‐, and long‐term effects (including adverse effects, benefits, and prognoses) of estradiol therapy alone, as opposed to combination therapy using estradiol together with cyproterone acetate or spironolactone?
    
2.  What is the short‐, medium‐, and long‐term clinical efficacy of hormone therapy when applied orally, transdermally, and intramuscularly?

Table 1 presents design components that we suggest could be used in future studies. Studies should be structured and reported according to the CONSORT Statement or the STROBE Statement in order to improve the quality of reporting on efficacy and to obtain better reports on harms in clinical research ([von Elm 2007](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0074 "vonElmE , AltmanDG , EggerM , PocockSJ , GøtzschePC , VandenbrouckeJP , STROBE Initiative. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement: guidelines for reporting observational studies.. Annals of Internal Medicine2007;147(8):573-7. [DOI: 10.7326/0003-4819-147-8-200710160-00010] [PMID: 17938396]"); [Schulz 2010](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0067 "SchulzKF , AltmanDG , MoherD . CONSORT 2010 Statement: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials. The BMJ2010;340:698-702. [DOI: 10.1136/bmj.c332]")). There is an urgent need for research in this area, not least for ethical reasons.

We will include non‐controlled cohort studies in the next iteration of this review, as this review has demonstrated that this is the highest quality evidence currently available in the field. We will take methodological limitations into account when doing so.

## Background

### Description of the condition

There is a growing trend towards de‐psychopathologisation of transgenderism ([Drescher 2014](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0029 "DrescherJ . Controversies in gender diagnoses. LGBT Health2014;1(1):10-14. [DOI: 1089/lgbt.2013.1500]"); [ATME 2015](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0015 "Aktion Transsexualität und Menschenrecht eV (ATME). Alternative recommendations for treatment in the presence of so-called \"sex/gender variance\". Medicine and psychotherapy without gender stereotyping. [STUTTGARTER ERKLÄRUNG - Alternative Handlungsempfehlungen bei geschlechtlichen Normvariationen]. In: In: v. Schreiber G editor(s). Transsexualität in Theologie und Neurowissenschaften ‐ Ergebnisse, Kontroversen, Perspektiven. Vol. 1. Berlin: De Gruyter, 2015:77-8. [ISBN: 978-3110440805]")). There is an emerging consensus that transgenderism is not a psychiatric disorder ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")). For instance, the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD‐11) ([WHO 2018](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0076 "World Health Organisation. International classification of diseases for mortality and morbidity statistics (11th Revision). icd.who.int/en/ (accessed 30 October 2020).")) no longer classifies transgenderism as a behavioural and personality disorder, but has instead drafted the term "gender incongruence" to describe gender dysphoria.

In contrast, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM–5) ([DSM‐5 2013](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0030 "American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Fifth edition. 1 edition. Vol. 1. Göttingen: Hogrefe, 2013. [ISBN: 9783801725990]")) describes gender dysphoria as a "marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, of at least six months duration, as manifested by at least two of the following" characteristics:

-   A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or, in young adolescents, the anticipated secondary sex characteristics);
    
-   A strong desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one’s experienced/expressed gender (or, in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex characteristics);
    
-   A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender;
    
-   A strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender);
    
-   A strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender);
    
-   A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender).
    

Gender dysphoria has been defined as associated with "clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning" ([Zucker 2016](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0079 "ZuckerKJ . The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria. In: TrombettaC , LiguoriG , BertolottoM , editors(s). Management of Gender Dysphoria - A Multidisciplinary Approach. First edition. Vol. 1. Mailand: Springer, 2016:33-7. [ISBN: 978-88-470-5695-4]")), which may lead to substantial suffering in affected people ([Deutsch 2016a](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0026 "DeutschM . Guidelines for the primary and gender-affirming care of transgender and gender nonbinary people. Center of Excellence for Transgender Health June 17th 2016;2nd Edition."); [Soll 2018](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0070 "SollBM , Robles-GarcíaR , Brandelli-CostaA , MoriD , MuellerA , Vaitses-FontanariAM , et al. Gender incongruence: a comparative study using ICD-10 and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry2018;40(2):174-80.")). Gender dysphoria may result in the desire to modify one's physical and sexual characteristics to be consistent with those of the experienced gender. This process of adaptation is called transition.

The treatments applied in transition differ from those used for maintenance of the new sexual characteristics. Currently, there is uncertainty about the value of hormone therapy as a sole intervention, or when combined with surgery, for transition from male to female. This Cochrane Review specifically focuses on ‘transgender women in transition from male to female,' a definition that includes biological males aiming to adapt their sexual characteristics to be consonant with those of females.

A meta‐analysis that analyzed 21 studies on the prevalence of gender dysphoria (of which 12 studies contained evaluable data) estimated an overall prevalence of transgender women with gender dysphoria at 6.8 per 100,000 individuals ([Arcelus 2015](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0014 "ArcelusJ , BoumanWP , Van Den NoortgateW , ClaesL , WitcombG , Fernandez-ArandaF . Systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence studies in transsexualism. European Psychiatry2015;30(6):807-15.")).

### Description of the intervention

Current guidelines suggest hormonal and, if needed, surgical treatment of gender dysphoria in transgender women ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")). Hormone therapy aims to suppress the development of, or to reverse, male attributes that have already developed. At the same time, hormones aim to develop female attributes. However, where male characteristics have already developed in adult males, such as in the bone structure of the face, hormones are not effective. Other treatments, such as surgery, would be required to change these ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")).

The guidelines of the Endocrine Society working group suggest treatment with both oestrogens and antiandrogens ([Hembree 2017](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0042 "HembreeWC , Cohen-KettenisP , Delemarre-van de WaalHA , GoorenL , HannemaSE , Meyer IIIWJ , et al. Endocrine treatment of transsexual persons: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism2017;102(11):3869-903. [DOI: 1210/jc.2017-01658]")). Oestrogens can be administered as either oral oestrogen, absorbed through transdermal estradiol patches, or by injection of estradiol valerate or estradiol cypionate. The application frequency differs depending on the patient’s reaction to the agent and the administration regimen; it could be multiple times per day or once every two weeks. Meanwhile, antiandrogens such as spironolactone or cyproterone acetate (CPA) are commonly taken orally. Additionally, it is possible to block male puberty by treatment with gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist injections ([Hembree 2017](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0042 "HembreeWC , Cohen-KettenisP , Delemarre-van de WaalHA , GoorenL , HannemaSE , Meyer IIIWJ , et al. Endocrine treatment of transsexual persons: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism2017;102(11):3869-903. [DOI: 1210/jc.2017-01658]")).

While not every transgender woman undergoes hormone therapy in her transition, this intervention is still widely used ([Hembree 2017](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0042 "HembreeWC , Cohen-KettenisP , Delemarre-van de WaalHA , GoorenL , HannemaSE , Meyer IIIWJ , et al. Endocrine treatment of transsexual persons: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism2017;102(11):3869-903. [DOI: 1210/jc.2017-01658]")). We know of no studies identifying the ratio of patients who undergo hormone therapy, nor do we know of studies investigating how much time passes between the start of transition (the decision to transition) and the start of hormone therapy. We are not aware of any studies on how often antiandrogens are being prescribed in addition to or instead of 17‐beta‐estradiol, how often they are being taken, or which kinds of androgens are in use besides CPA and spironolactone.

### How the intervention might work

Several hormonal substances and combinations are used clinically for hormone therapy in transitioning women. CPA is a progestin, steroidal anti‐androgen and anti‐gonadotropin that blocks the receptors for testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and thereby prevents these steroidal hormones from exerting their androgenic effects. Hence, it stops processes like body hair growth, hair loss on the head, male body fat distribution and others ([Figg 2010](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0032 "FiggW , ChauCH , CindyH , SmallEJ . Drug Management of Prostate Cancer. 1 edition. New York: Springer, 2010. [ISBN: 978-1-60327-829-4]"); [WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")). According to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) guidelines, it is possible to suppress puberty with GnRH analogues or progestins such as medroxyprogesterone ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")).

Spironolactone acts as a weak androgen receptor antagonist ([Wenqing 2005](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0075 "WenqingG , BohlCE , DaltonJT . Chemistry and structural biology of androgen receptor. Chemical Reviews2005;105(9):3352-70. [DOI: 10.1021/cr020456u]")). It also causes an increase in oestradiol levels ([Thompson 1993](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0073 "ThompsonDF , CarterJR . Drug-induced gynecomastia. Pharmacotherapy Jan-Feb 1993;13(1):37-45. [PMID: 8094898]")), so that further virilisation is prevented and feminisation occurs ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")).

17‐beta‐estradiol is used to feminise the external appearance ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")). It binds to oestrogen receptors and thus ensures gene expression, which in turn feminises appearance ([Hye‐Rim 2012](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0050 "Hye-RimL , Tae-HeeK , Kyung-ChulC . Functions and physiological roles of two types of estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ, identified by estrogen receptor knockout mouse. Laboratory Animal Research2012;28(2):71-6. [DOI: 5625/lar.2012.28.2.71]")). In addition, estradiol suppresses gonadal testosterone production via the control systems of the hypothalamus ([Hayes 2000](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0040 "HayesFJ , SeminaraSB , DecruzS , BoepplePA , Crowley WF Jr. Aromatase inhibition in the human male reveals a hypothalamic site of estrogen feedback. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism2000;85(9):3027-35. [DOI: 0021-972X/00/$03.00/0]")).

Feminisation therapy aims to adapt the physical appearance and experience of the male body to that of a female body, by inducing breast growth, softening facial features, and inducing other physical changes commonly considered to comprise a feminine appearance ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")). For this purpose, oral or transdermal oestrogen is recommended, and therapy with oestrogen in combination with antiandrogens is most common. Co‐treatment with antiandrogens minimises the required dose of oestrogen, and thereby reduces the potential risks of oestrogen identified in previous studies ([Schürmeyer 1986](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0068 "SchürmeyerT , GraffJ , SengeT , NieschlagE . Effect of oestrogen or cyproterone acetate treatment on adrenocortical function in prostate carcinoma patients. Acta Endocrinologica1986;111(3):360-7. [PMID: 2421511]"); [Prior 1989](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0059 "PriorCJ , VignaYM , WatsonD . Spironolactone with physiological female steroids for presurgical therapy of male-to-female transsexualism. Archives of Sexual Behavior1989;18(1):49-57. [DOI: 18(1):49-57]")). Some antiandrogens are approved by WPATH, such as spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, GnRH analogues like goserelin, and 5‐alpha‐reductase inhibitors like finasteride ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")).

### Why it is important to do this review

Antiandrogens like CPA and spironolactone are prescribed to transgender women in transition by clinicians, including gynaecologists and endocrinologists ([Schneider 2006](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0065 "SchneiderH , StallaG .

However, clinical evidence suggests that taking these drugs can result in adverse events; for example, CPA has significant potential for causing depression and for worsening depressive symptoms ([Seal 2012](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0069 "SealLJ , FranklinS , RichardsC , ShishkarevaA , SinclaireC , BarretJ .

There is also some concern that CPA can lead to other psychiatric, neurological, and metabolic disorders ([Griard 1978](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0039 "GriardJ , BühlerU , ZuppingerK , HaasHG , StaubJJ , WyssHI .

Liver International: Official Journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver.2015;36(2):302-10. [DOI: 1111/liv.12899]")). The most common adverse effects of spironolactone are hyperkalaemia, dehydration and hyponatraemia ([Greenblatt 1973](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0038 "GreenblattDJ , Koch-WeserJ . Adverse reactions to spironolactone. JAMA1973;225(1):40-3. [DOI: 1001/jama.1973.03220280028007]")). Furthermore, spironolactone might have an influence on feelings of anxiety ([Fox 2016](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0034 "FoxLC , DaviesDR , SchollJL , WattMJ , ForsterGL .

Other studies from the 1980s and 90s reported that there were adverse effects from high‐dose estradiol, but these studies used ethinyl estradiol or equine premarin (equine estradiol) instead of bioidentical 17‐beta‐estradiol; and used progestins, instead of bioidentical progesterone. This may have contributed to the adverse effect profile of these specific treatments ([Prior 1989](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0059 "PriorCJ , VignaYM , WatsonD . Spironolactone with physiological female steroids for presurgical therapy of male-to-female transsexualism. Archives of Sexual Behavior1989;18(1):49-57. [DOI: 18(1):49-57]")). Unlike the bioidentical alternatives used today (hormone preparations made from plant sources that are similar or identical to human hormones), substances administered in the past (e.g. equine oestrogens, ethinyl estradiol) were associated with more diverse adverse effects like thrombophilia, cardiovascular problems, breast and prostate cancer, as well as liver, adrenal gland and neural dysfunction ([Griard 1978](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0039 "GriardJ , BühlerU , ZuppingerK , HaasHG , StaubJJ , WyssHI .

The health risks attributed to estradiol doses high enough to suppress androgens have not been found in the parenteral or transdermal application of bioidentical estradiol ([Hembree 2017](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0042 "HembreeWC , Cohen-KettenisP , Delemarre-van de WaalHA , GoorenL , HannemaSE , Meyer IIIWJ , et al.

Thus, it is unclear why those estradiol doses should be kept low in order to make the addition of androgen antagonists like CPA or spironolactone necessary.

In light of discussions among experts ([Seal 2012](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0069 "SealLJ , FranklinS , RichardsC , ShishkarevaA , SinclaireC , BarretJ . Predictive markers for mammoplasty and a comparison of side effect profiles in transwomen taking various hormonal regimens. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism2012;97(12):4422-8. [DOI: 1210/jc.2012-2030]"); [Wierckx 2014](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0077 "WierckxK , vanCaenegemE , SchreinerT , HaraldsenI , FisherAD , ToyeK , et al. Cross-sex hormone therapy in trans persons is safe and effective at short-time follow-up: results from the European network for the investigation of gender incongruence. International Society for Sexual Medicine2014;11(8):1999-2011. [10.1111/jsm.12571]")), and current recommendations for hormonal gender affirmation treatment ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")), it is necessary to review the evidence from trials that show results for outcomes such as feminisation, satisfactory sexual function, reduced gender dysphoria, and improved quality of life (e.g. [Murad 2010](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0056 "MuradMH , ElaminMB , GarciaMZ , MullanRJ , MuradA , ErwinPJ , et al. Hormonal therapy and sex reassignment:a systematic review and meta-analysis of quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Clinical Endocrinology2010;72(2):214-31. [DOI: 1111/j.1365-2265.2009.03625.x]")).

In 2017, the overall quality of evidence relating to these outcomes was classified as low ([Hembree 2017](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0042 "HembreeWC , Cohen-KettenisP , Delemarre-van de WaalHA , GoorenL , HannemaSE , Meyer IIIWJ , et al. Endocrine treatment of transsexual persons: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism2017;102(11):3869-903. [DOI: 1210/jc.2017-01658]")). In 2011, WPATH summarised the situation as follows. "There is a need for further research on the effects of hormone therapy without surgery, and without the goal of maximum physical feminisation or masculinisation" ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")). It is necessary to determine whether subsequent trials have provided additional evidence for efficacy, or whether there is still a lack of evidence for these desired outcomes.

## Objectives

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of hormone therapy with antiandrogens, estradiol, or both, compared to each other or placebo, in transgender women in transition.

## Methods

### Criteria for considering studies for this review

#### Types of studies

We aimed to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs and controlled cohort studies.

We chose to include quasi‐RCTs and cohort studies due to the low prevalence of the condition and the consequent current scarcity of RCTs ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")).

#### Types of participants

We aimed to include studies that enrolled transgender women, age 16 years and over, in transition from male to female. Transitioning is defined as the process of changing one's gender profile or sexual characteristics (or both) to accord with one's sense of gender identity ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")). Transition as a concept thus encompasses several aspects, e.g. social, psychological, or physical aspects, or a combination of these. There is consistency in the literature on when the transition begins: namely, with the decision to change a person's gender assignment ([Brown 1996](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0020 "BrownML , RounsleyCA . True Selves: Understanding Transsexualism - For Families, Friends, Coworkers, and Helping Professionals. 1 edition. Vol. 1. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1996. [ISBN: 0-7879-6702-5]")). However, we did not differentiate among any supposed phases of the respective types of transitions. Depending on the personal situation, the process of transition (which may include the decision to transition, gathering of information, gathering of experience, medical treatment and change of social role), can take very different periods of time, usually several months to years. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish certain 'phases' of this process. When focusing on hormone therapy, the transition term can be more precisely defined. The transition process lasts as long as patients are in the process of changing their sexual characteristics ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")).We aimed to include studies with participants age 16 years and older because, according to currently applied guidelines, this is the age when patients start being treated with hormone therapy. Patients below this age are usually being treated with puberty blockers, which are outside the scope of this review ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")).

#### Types of interventions

We considered studies evaluating hormone‐based interventions only, excluding those that examined combined hormonal and either psychological or surgical treatments. We aimed to include studies reporting treatment with the following experimental interventions.

-   Antiandrogens (cyproterone acetate or spironolactone) and estradiol
    
-   Antiandrogens (cyproterone acetate or spironolactone) alone
    
-   Estradiol alone
    

For the above interventions, we considered all types of administration: oral, sublingual, transdermal, subdermal and intramuscular. For estradiol, we also considered bioidentical 17‐beta‐estradiol, as well as synthetic derivatives.

We aimed to include the following comparator interventions.

-   Any of the active interventions listed above
    
-   Placebo
    

Although we consider placebo‐controlled studies to be unethical ([Bostick 2008](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0019 "BostickNA , SadeR , LevineMA , Stewart JrDM . Placebo use in clinical practice: report of the American Medical Association Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs. The Journal of Clinical Ethics2008;19(1):58-61. [PMID: 18552054]")), we made them eligible for inclusion in this review so that we could consider the evidence in its entirety. We did not consider interventions consisting purely of psychological treatment, spiritual support, or conversion therapy.

#### Types of outcome measures

For studies with repeated follow‐up (i.e. reporting of outcomes at multiple time points), we regarded follow‐up at three to six months as short term, six months to two years as medium term, and more than two years as long term ([WPATH 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0078 "ColemanE , BocktingW , BotzerM , Cohen-KettenisP , DeCuypereG , FeldmanJ , et al. Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people version 7. International Journal of Transgenderism2011;13(4):165–232. [DOI: 10.1080/15532739.2011.700873]")).

We intended to include in the descriptive section of the review all studies that met the criteria for type of study, participants, intervention and comparator, regardless of outcomes reported or missing data.

##### Primary outcomes

-   Quality of life (QoL) as measured by validated generic instruments, e.g. Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI) ([Frisch 2005](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0035 "FrischMB , ClarkMP , RouseSV , RuddMD , PaweleckJK , GreenstoneA , et al. Predictive and treatment validity of life satisfaction and the quality of life inventory. Assessment2005;12(1):66-78. [DOI: 1177/1073191104268006]")); or specific instruments, e.g. for body image, the Body Image Quality of Life Inventory (BIQLI) ([Cash 2004](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0022 "CashTF , JakatdarTA , WilliamsEF . The body image quality of life inventory: further validation with college men and women. Body Image2004;1(3):279–87. [DOI: 1016/S1740-1445(03)00023-8]")); or for sexual life the Sexual Satisfaction Scale for Women (SSS‐W) ([Meston 2005](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0053 "MestonC , TrapnellP . Development and validation of a five-factor sexual satisfaction and distress scale for women: the Sexual Satisfaction Scale for Women (SSS-W). The Journal of Sexual Medicine2005;2(1):66-81.")).
    
-   Satisfaction with change of male to female body characteristics, as measured with validated instruments
    
-   Adverse events specific to hormone therapy, including serious adverse events
    

##### Secondary outcomes

-   Severity of gender dysphoria/gender incongruence, e.g. as measured with the Utrecht Gender Dysphoria Scale (UGDS) ([Schneider 2016](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0066 "SchneiderC , CerwenkaS , NiederTO , BrikenP , Cohen-KettenisPT , deCuypereG , et al.

Archives of Sexual Behavior2013;45(3):551-8. [DOI: 1007/s10508-016-0702-x]"))
    
-   Measures of specific body changes, including:
    
    -   breast size, e.g. by measurement of bust girth;
        
    -   skin thickness, e.g. by echographic measurement ([Laurent 2007](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0052 "LaurentA , MistrettaF , BottigioliD , DahelK , GoujonC , NicolasJF , et al.

[DOI: 25(34):6423-6430]"));
        
    -   skin sebum production, e.g. as measured by three‐hour sebum collection with absorbent paper ([Downing 1981](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0028 "DowningDT , StewartME , StraussJS .

    -   hair growth, including hair density, diameter, growth rate and anagen/telogen ratio ([Giltay 2000](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0006 "GiltayEJ , GoorenL . Effects of sex steroid deprivation/administration on hair growth and skin sebum production in transsexual males and females. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism2000;85(8):2913-21.

-   Incidence or severity of depression.

We did not include surrogate outcomes, such as serum hormone levels (e.g. 17‐beta‐estradiol or testosterone). While these measures can help with monitoring the progress of hormone therapy, they are of little interest of themselves, especially since individuals require varying levels of these hormones to achieve a certain level of feminisation ([Gooren 2017](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0037 "den HeijerM , BakkerA , GoorenL . Long term hormonal treatment for transgender people. The BMJ2017;359(j5027):n/a. [DOI: 1136/bmj.j5027]")).

### Search methods for identification of studies

#### Electronic searches

We searched the following electronic databases for relevant trials up to 19 December 2019 with no restrictions based on language of publication, date of publication, or publication status:

-   MEDLINE via PubMed
    
-   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)
    
-   Embase
    
-   Biosis Preview
    
-   PsycINFO
    
-   PSYNDEX

Our search strategy is outlined in [Appendix 1](../appendices/zh_HANS#CD013138-sec-0059). We have successfully tested the screening methods for abstracts and titles.

#### Searching other resources

Had we identified any eligible studies through the electronic searches above, we would have searched the reference lists of these in order to find additional relevant studies. We also searched the scientific abstracts of the last two meetings of each of the following organisations:

-   American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists
    
-   American Society of Andrology
    
-   Berufsverband der deutschen Endokrinologen (Professional Association of the German Endocrinologists)
    
-   Berufsverband der Frauenärzte e.V. (Professional Association of the Gynaecologists)
    
-   Dachverband Reproduktionsbiologie und Medizin e.V. (Federal Association Reproductive Biology and Medicine)
    
-   Deutsche Gesellschaft für Endokrinologie (German Society for Endocrinology)
    
-   Deutsche Gesellschaft für Gynäkologie und Geburtshilfe (German Society for Gynaecology and Obstretics)
    
-   Endocrine Society
    
-   European Society of Gynaecological Oncology
    
-   European Thyroid Association
    
-   Nordrhein‐Westfälische Gesellschaft für Endokrinologie und Diabetologie (North Rhine‐Westphalian Society for Endocrinology and Diabetology)
    
-   Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
    
-   Society for Endocrinology
    
-   Society for Gynaecologic Investigation

We also searched the following grey literature databases:

-   The New York Academy of Medicine Grey Literature Report ([www.greylit.org/](http://www.greylit.org/))
    
-   OAIster ([www.oclc.org/oaister.en.html](http://www.oclc.org/oaister.en.html))
    
-   OpenGrey ([www.opengrey.eu/](http://www.opengrey.eu/)) 

Finally, in order to identify completed but unpublished or ongoing studies, we searched the following trial registries.

-   ClinicalTrials.gov ([www.clinicaltrials.gov/](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/)) 
    
-   metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT; [www.controlledtrials.com/mrct/](http://www.controlledtrials.com/mrct/))
    
-   World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal ([www.who.int/trialsearch/](http://www.who.int/trialsearch/))
    
-   Drugs@FDA ([www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/)) 
    
-   European Public Assessment Reports (EPAR; [www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/landing/epar_search.jsp](http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/landing/epar_search.jsp))

We contacted fifteen manufacturers of hormonal agents and experts in the field to identify unpublished or ongoing trials.

### Data collection and analysis

#### Selection of studies

We used the reference management tool Covidence to identify and remove potential duplicate records of relevant studies ([www.covidence.org](http://www.covidence.org)). Two review authors (AKU and MHE) independently scanned titles and abstracts of the remaining records to compile a list of potential papers to potentially be included in the review. After this, the same review authors investigated the references in detail (as full text articles or matched records to studies) and categorised these as ‘included studies,' ‘excluded studies,' ‘studies awaiting classification' and ‘ongoing studies.' We executed this task in accordance with the criteria provided in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ([Higgins 2011a](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0044 "HigginsJPT , DeeksJJ . Chapter 7: Selecting studies and collecting data. In: Higgins JPT, Deeks JJ, editor(s), Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011). The Cochrane Collaboration, 2011. Available from handbook.cochrane.org.")). If there had been discrepancies or if a consensus could not be reached, a third review author would have adjudicated (CHA). There were no disagreements that could not be thus resolved. Had this been the case, we would have designated the study as ‘awaiting classification' and contacted the study authors for clarification. We listed studies excluded during the full text review stage and documented the reasons for exclusion in [Characteristics of excluded studies](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-sec-0064). We included an adapted PRISMA flow diagram outlining the study selection process ([Moher 2009](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0055 "MoherD , LiberatiA , TetzlaffJ , AltmanDG . The PRISMA Group (2009). Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses: The PRISMA statement. Annals of Internal Medicine2009;151(4):264-9. [DOI: 7326/0003-4819-151-4-200908180-00135]")) ([Figure 1](#CD013138-fig-0001)).

Study Flow Diagram

#### Data extraction and management

If we had found relevant studies, two review authors (AKU and MHE) would have extracted data from all studies deemed eligible for inclusion independently, with the help of a standardized data extraction form that would have been pilot tested according to Chapter 7 of the _Cochrane Handbook_ ([Higgins 2011a](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0044 "HigginsJPT , DeeksJJ . Chapter 7: Selecting studies and collecting data. In: Higgins JPT, Deeks JJ, editor(s), Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011). The Cochrane Collaboration, 2011. Available from handbook.cochrane.org.")). We have used Google Spreadsheets to manage all data gathered.

We would have collected data on the following items:

-   General information on the study: first author, date of publication, study dates, publication type (full text article, abstract, unpublished), citation.
    
-   Study methods: study design (e.g. parallel, factorial), number of study arms, study setting (single institution, multi‐centre national, multi‐centre international), study location, and length of follow‐up.
    
-   Participant characteristics: study inclusion/exclusion criteria, age (mean/median with range), ethnic distribution, number of participants randomised and included in analysis, participants lost to follow‐up.
    
-   Interventions: type of hormonal agents (for example CPA, estradiol, progesterone, spironolactone), dose, administration route, dosing schedule and any other associated therapies. We would have extracted data on the sample size for each intervention group.
    
-   Outcomes: definition and method of assessment for each outcome (including the adverse event classification system used in individual studies), as well as any relevant subgroups. We would have extracted the number of events and participants per treatment group for dichotomous outcomes. We would also extract the mean, standard deviation or median and range, and number of participants per treatment group for continuous outcomes.
    
-   Study funding sources.
    
-   Declarations of potential conflicts of interest reported by study authors.
    

For each included study, we would have extracted the outcome data relevant for this review, and which would be required for the calculation of summary statistics and measures of variance. If there had been disagreements, we would have resolved them by discussion. If necessary, we would have consulted a third review author (CHA). We provided key information about potentially relevant ongoing studies, including trial identifiers, in the table of [Characteristics of ongoing studies](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-sec-0065). We would have attempted to contact authors of included studies to obtain missing key data if needed.

#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

If relevant studies had been found, two review authors (AKU and MHE) would have examined all included studies to assess risk of bias (assessment of methodological quality) independently. We would have used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool for assessing risk of bias in RCTs, as described in the _Cochrane Handbook_ ([Higgins 2011b](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0045 "HigginsJPT , DeeksJJ . Chapter 8: Assessing risk of bias in included studies. In: Higgins JPT, Altman DG, Sterne JAC, editor(s), Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011). The Cochrane Collaboration, 2011. Available from handbook.cochrane.org.")). We would have resolved disagreements by consensus or by consulting a third review author (CHA). Our summary judgement would have included a rating (low, high or unclear risk of bias) for each domain ([Higgins 2011b](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0045 "HigginsJPT , DeeksJJ . Chapter 8: Assessing risk of bias in included studies. In: Higgins JPT, Altman DG, Sterne JAC, editor(s), Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011). The Cochrane Collaboration, 2011. Available from handbook.cochrane.org.")). We would have assessed the risk of bias for the following domains:

-   Random sequence generation
    
-   Allocation concealment
    
-   Blinding of participants and personnel
    
-   Blinding of outcome assessment
    
-   Incomplete outcome data
    
-   Selective reporting
    
-   Other bias
    

We would have evaluated the risks of performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel) and detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment) separately for each outcome.

For any relevant cohort studies we would have used the ROBINS‐I tool to assess risk of bias ([Sterne 2016](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0072 "SterneJAC , HernánMA , ReevesBC , SavovićJ , BerkmanND , ViswanathanM , et al. ROBINS-I: a tool for assessing risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions. BMJ2016;355:i4919. [DOI: 10.1136/bmj.i4919]")). We would have assessed each individual study in accordance with the guidance, documenting the results using a spreadsheet and providing details in ‘Risk of bias' tables. We would have documented the reasons for our judgements, and would have included relevant quotations from the full‐text articles or from information about the study provided by authors in the notes section of the 'Risk of bias' tables. We would have summarised the risk of bias across domains for each primary outcome in every included study, as well as across studies and domains for each primary outcome.

#### Measures of treatment effect

##### Dichotomous data

We planned to summarise dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs), reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

##### Continuous data

For continuous outcomes with a standard measure, we would have summarised the obtained data as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. For continuous outcomes without a standard measure, we would have summarised data as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs. Alternatively, if the mean value and variance were missing, we would have estimated them using the methods described in [Hozo 2005](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0049 "HozoSP , DjulbegovicB , IztokI . Estimating the mean and variance from the median, range, and the size of a sample. BMC Medical Research Methodology2005;13(5). [DOI: 1186/1471-2288-5-13]"), which allows estimations for mean value and variance of a sample when only the median, range and size of the sample are known. We would also have considered the guidance in the _Cochrane Handbook_ where appropriate ([Higgins 2011c](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0046 "HigginsJPT , DeeksJJ . Chapter 9: Analysing data and undertaking meta-analyses. In: Deeks JJ, Higgins JPT, Altman DG, editor(s), Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011). The Cochrane Collaboration, 2011. Available from handbook.cochrane.org.")).

#### Unit of analysis issues

We planned to treat recurring events in individual participants as single events occurring in one participant (e.g. three episodes of major depressive disorder in one participant would have been recorded as one participant with major depressive disorder). We did not expect to include studies with interventions delivered at the cluster level.

#### Dealing with missing data

For studies with missing data, we would have followed the recommendations of the _Cochrane Handbook_ ([Higgins 2011d](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0047 "HigginsJPT , DeeksJJ . Chapter 16: General principles for dealing with missing data. In: Higgins JPT, Deeks JJ, Altman DG, editor(s), Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011). The Cochrane Collaboration, 2011. Available from handbook.cochrane.org.")). We would have collected dropout rates for each study group and would have reported these in the ‘Risk of bias' table. Our preferred option would have been to contact study authors in cases of missing data or statistics that were not due to participant dropout (e.g. missing statistics such as standard deviation (SD)). If missing outcome data were not provided, then we would have attempted to impute data where possible and appropriate, and conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of this on the analysis. However, where imputation is not appropriate, we would not have included the study in the respective meta‐analysis, and would have discussed the potential impact of this in the text of the review. In the case of participants lost to follow‐up, we would have performed meta‐analyses on an intention‐to‐treat basis. We would have performed sensitivity analyses, excluding studies with missing outcome data, to evaluate the impact of missing data. We would have discussed the potential impact of missing data on review findings in the ‘Discussion' section of the full review, using a summary table if appropriate.

#### Assessment of heterogeneity

We would have compared the characteristics of included studies to identify heterogeneity of content or methodology, and to determine the feasibility of performing a meta‐analysis. We would have deemed meta‐analyses unsuitable in cases where there was substantial content‐related or methodological heterogeneity across studies. Instead, we would have used a narrative approach to data synthesis. Had meta‐analyses been deemed appropriate, we would have assessed statistical heterogeneity by visually inspecting the scatter of individual study effect estimates on forest plots and by calculating the I2 statistic ([Higgins 2011c](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0046 "HigginsJPT , DeeksJJ . Chapter 9: Analysing data and undertaking meta-analyses. In: Deeks JJ, Higgins JPT, Altman DG, editor(s), Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011). The Cochrane Collaboration, 2011. Available from handbook.cochrane.org.")), which gives the percentage of variability in effect estimations that can be attributed to heterogeneity rather than to chance. We would have considered an I2 of more than 50% to represent substantial heterogeneity. In the case of statistical heterogeneity, we would have conducted the prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses described below to investigate the source.

#### Assessment of reporting biases

If we had included 10 or more studies that investigated the same outcome, we would have used funnel plots to assess small‐study effects and publication bias. Given that several explanations are possible for funnel plot asymmetry, we would have interpreted results carefully ([Sterne 2011](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0071 "SterneJA , SuttonAJ , IoannidisJP , TerrinN , JonesDR , LauJ , et al. Recommendations for examining and interpreting funnel plot asymmetry in meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. BMJ2011;343. [343:d4002]")).

#### Data synthesis

Had we identified any eligible studies, we would have provided a narrative summary of the included studies. We would also have conducted meta‐analyses of RCTs for all relevant outcomes, where possible, using data from studies that 1) compared the actual hormone therapy‐relevant agents or combinations of agents to placebo, and 2) compared the actual hormone therapy‐relevant agents or combinations of agents to other hormone therapy‐agents or combinations of agents. Studies comparing two variations on the intervention would have been pooled separately to studies comparing the intervention to placebo. However, if there had been significant variability in the definition of outcomes across trials, we would have decided not to pool data.

Had we conducted meta‐analyses, we would have used the Mantel‐Haenszel approach to combine dichotomous data and calculate RRs with 95% CIs ([Higgins 2011c](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0046 "HigginsJPT , DeeksJJ . Chapter 9: Analysing data and undertaking meta-analyses. In: Deeks JJ, Higgins JPT, Altman DG, editor(s), Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011). The Cochrane Collaboration, 2011. Available from handbook.cochrane.org.")). For continuous outcomes (e.g. quality of life) we would have calculated MDs or SMDs, with 95% CIs, using the inverse variance approach. Had studies reported the same outcome measure but some studies had reported data on the change from baseline (e.g. mean values and standard deviations) and others for final measurements of outcomes, they would have been placed in subgroups in the meta‐analysis and pooled according to guidance in the _Cochrane Handbook_ ([Higgins 2011c](../references/zh_HANS#CD013138-bbs2-0046 "HigginsJPT , DeeksJJ . Chapter 9: Analysing data and undertaking meta-analyses. In: Deeks JJ, Higgins JPT, Altman DG, editor(s), Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011).
