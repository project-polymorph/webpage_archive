## Abstract
**Objective** To better understand the diversity of gender identity and sexual orientation of college students, and provide a theoretical basis for sex education in universities.  
**Methods** A questionnaire survey was carried out in a comprehensive university in Shanghai. A total of 785 valid questionnaires were collected by anonymous replying. The data of gender identity and sexual orientation were analyzed.  
**Results** There were 359 males (45.7%), 424 females (54.0%) and 2 transgenders (0.3%) in the valid questionnaires. 32.8% of the girls wanted to choose the male sex. The number of "heterosexual" was 559 (71.21%), and the number of "non-heterosexual" was 226 (28.79%). The homosexual tendency score of women was significantly higher than that of men. Among non-heterosexuals, 42 (31.34%) had "never come out to anyone"; 8.41% of college students would sympathize with and alienate homosexuals; 1.40% select disconnect.  
**Conclusion** The trend of diversity of gender identity and sexual orientation of college students is emerging, but there is a huge resistance to the expression of their sexual orientation. College campuses not only urgently need sex physiology education, but should pay more attention to comprehensive sex education based on inclusion and tolerance.
