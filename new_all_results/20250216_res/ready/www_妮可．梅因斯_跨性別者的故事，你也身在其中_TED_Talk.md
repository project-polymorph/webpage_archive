00:03

For as long as I can remember, I've always recognized myself as a girl.

I hung out with all of the other girls, I talked like the other girls,

and I had eyes only for makeup, Barbies and girls' toys,

all of which could be found in the "pink aisle" at Toys 'R' Us.

Before my hair had grown long,

I would wear my favorite red turtleneck around my head

like Ariel's long flowing hair,

and every Halloween,

I would tell my parents I wanted to be a girl.

A witch one year,

and a princess the next year,

and another princess the following year, but you know, Disney.

00:37

(Laughter)

00:38

The point is, I was clearly a girl,

but the one thing that I couldn't beg my parents into getting for me

was actual girlhood.

00:47

Now if you haven't figured it out already, I am transgender,

but don't worry, I'm not here to raid your bathrooms

and take your women.

00:54

(Laughter)

00:56

I am here to tell you what it's like to be trans,

what it's like to struggle every day with acceptance from yourself

and those around you.

And of course, that inevitable question of "which bathroom do we put this kid in."

01:10

I was born in upstate New York

with an identical twin brother 10 minutes behind me,

a mother who always did her best to make sure I was happy

and a father whose expectations for a son I did not exactly meet.

He expected that my brother and I --

Jonas, that's his name --

and before you say anything,

yes, I know our names together, Nicole and Jonas,

do sound like "Nick Jonas" --

he expected that Jonas and I were each going to get our own baseball gloves,

play catch with him and go hunting.

In fairness, we did do some of these things.

I turned out to hit a better home run than my brother,

and I could do it in heels.

01:48

(Laughter)

01:50

But because of the expectations that my father had,

it was harder for him to accept his child as transgender.

He wasn't prepared,

and he didn't have the information on how to raise a transgender kid.

And of course, there was always that question for him,

"What do the neighbors think?"

So rather than deal with me,

he buried himself in hobbies

and tried to ignore the flamboyance of his son.

02:16

As you can imagine,

this left my mother pretty on her own for a while,

when my brother and I were little.

She's an independent woman,

and always tries her best to see the best in people.

So when it came to her child's gender,

she didn't have a lot of expectations

for what me and Jonas were supposed to be like.

She didn't care what the neighbors thought.

She cared whether or not we were safe around the neighbors.

She knew that the world wasn't always going to be an accepting place,

so she vowed that at the very least,

I was going to have a safe place to come back to in her home.

02:51

The only problem with that, though,

was that my dad at home didn't get it,

so she started trying to educate him.

She left some literature lying around for him,

but when he didn't show much interest,

she did what any other sensible spouse would do.

She left the book in the bathroom.

03:10

(Laughter)

03:12

And lo and behold,

when he had run out of other stuff to read in there,

there was the book --

“She’s Not There” by Jennifer Boylan.

This was the beginning of my dad really trying to come around

to me being transgender,

and everyone in my family helped,

including Jonas, who, at no more than eight,

walked up to my dad and said,

"Face it.

You have a son,

and a daughter."

03:37

With my family on board,

we could start trying to make my transition public.

We worked with the school up in Orono,

which is where we moved when Jonas and I were five,

and we all decided on a gradual transition.

What this meant was,

I wasn't going to burst into school one day in a full dress, pearls and heels,

and let everyone process that.

What it meant was that we were going to spread my transition out

over the course of elementary school,

starting with pink,

wearing my hair longer,

using the single-stall girls' bathroom,

followed in fifth grade by the multistall girls' bathroom,

wearing skirts,

and finally, using my name, Nicole.

What I really liked about the gradual transition

was that everyone was cooperating,

and it put no strain on the other students,

because they were all eased into it with me.

04:25

Everything was perfect.

Until in fifth grade ...

A student who had moved there the year before

and wasn't there for our gradual transition

told his grandfather about me.

And his grandfather

was part of a special-interest Christian Right group,

and he didn't think that my using the girls' bathroom was OK at all.

So logically,

the best course of action was to send his grandson in after me.

His grandson follows me into the girls' bathroom one day,

looks me in the face and says,

"My grandpappy says we don't have to have any faggots in our school."

05:05

I didn't know it at the time,

but that was the beginning

of all of my family's hard work coming apart.

The school stopped cooperating with us.

They pulled me from the girls' bathroom

and made me up to be the one who'd done something wrong.

After a few months of isolation,

I decided to start using the girls' bathroom again

of my own accord.

But when the grandson caught on, he made another stunt,

and again, I found myself in the principal's office,

with her giving me a look and saying,

"You knew you weren't supposed to go in there."

So from then on, through the end of sixth grade,

I was to have a bodyguard,

who was to follow me at all times,

stand 10 feet behind me

and make sure that I use the isolation chamber of a bathroom,

just because the school was afraid that the grandfather's group would sue.

I would get up to go to the bathroom from class,

and the teacher would stop me at the door

and tell me to wait for whoever was following me that day,

in front of everybody.

The humiliation was unimaginable.

06:12

My family eventually had to leave that school

and leave Orono，

因为学校不能且不会被说服。

在接下来两年的时间里，我们不得不生活在隐形中。

生活分开，因为我父亲不得不留在那儿工作。

在接下来的两年中，我的父母不得不警告我和乔纳斯，永远不要告诉任何人我们是谁，否则我们就不得不再次移动。

所以我在那两年里沉寂了。

我没有任何过夜聚会，

我没有去拜访任何朋友。

我就像一个鬼魂。

我上学，回家。

06:50

当高中学习到来时，

我们接到一家当地私立学校的邀请，

一个名叫Waynflete的地方。

在那里的访问中，我了解到他们是进步和前瞻性的。

我和我兄弟都被录取了。

最好的部分是，

我的父母告诉我们，在这所新学校，

我们不再需要隐藏。

所以在Waynflete，他们开始每个学年

通过将学生放在华盖中间的森林中并告诉我们“相处”。

这是迷人的。

07:26

(Laughter)

我们住在游牧帐篷。

07:29

(Laughter)

07:31

但在这次旅行中，

我注意到我正在斗争的事情。

我不知道该如何告诉这些孩子我是谁。

在那两年的秘密保存中，

我实际上忘记了如何向人们出柜。

以前是如此简单——

你知道，我只需走上前跟某人说，

“我叫Wyatt，

我是一个想要成为女孩的男孩。你叫什么名字？”
 
07:58

(Laughter)

07:59

但现在对我来说是一种神秘。

所以我在整个旅程中保持沉默，

我记得当我看到所有新同学一起去湖边时

我有多不舒服。

08:15

在回家的巴士上，

我坐在一个名叫Leah的女孩旁边，

我跟她走得特别近，

在车程的中间，她告诉我她有一个秘密。

她告诉我，她是泛性恋。

想象一下我的宽慰。

所以...

你知道，这是我的机会，

我紧紧抓住这个孩子——

我是说，我抓住了她并抱住她。

我在那辆巴士上向她出柜，

这是两年来的第一次。

她实际上告诉我...

这很酷。

她问我几个问题，

而她真正做的事情是给了我一个

在过去几年中没有的空间。

她给了我信心，继续向其他孩子出柜，因为随着时间的推移，

我得到的每一个回应都是非常“是的，还有？”

我作为跨性别者的事实对这些孩子来说不是大新闻，

他们让我觉得这世界是最正常的事情。

因为它是。

09:19

在我在Waynflete期间发生了另一件奇怪的事情。

在我在那里四年的某个时候——

我不知道是什么时候——

我开始接受做跨性别者的自己。

我可以接受自己和我的身体。

我开始感到正常，甚至还没有意识到。

我能够达到一个程度...

你知道，我对自己底下的东西并不完全舒服，

但通常这并不是最大的悲剧。

而正是像Leah这样的人给了我这样的空间。

09:58

在家里的接受是基础，但...

老实说，这还不够。

跨性别青少年，像大多数年轻人一样，

花费大多数时间在学校里。

如果你在星期一至星期五，从早上8点到下午3点，

总是被告知你不OK，

你是错的，

你该如何想其他的呢？

10:22

家和社区的共同接受创造了一个空间，让孩子们能够接受自己。

我能够做到这一点是因为我的跨性别的事实并没有不断地强加给我。

我不必每一秒都在想着它，隐藏它

并感觉自己是一个异常。

跨性别孩子，我们处理这个两到三岁的性别概念。

顺性别孩子，你们的性别立即得到了确认。

但跨性别孩子不这样。

我们无法专注于长大后想要成为什么。

我甚至不记得。

我只记得我需要成为女孩。

在那得到确认和验证之前，我不能继续。

我被困在性别中。

在每一个法律表格中都会提醒到这一点。

护照、驾照、税单、申请表，

甚至厕所被分开，男性和女性。

11:33

现在我可以为大家强调许多重要的信息。

而且相信我，我可以一直告诉你

在争取跨性别平等的斗争中需要做的每一件小事，

但我会省略。

我希望你们今天离开这里时知道

你可以成为Leah。

你有能力在某人的生活中产生改变。

因为你永远不知道

什么时候一个跨性别者会进入你的生活，

你需要做好准备，准备帮助他们。

它可能是你孙子学校的某个孩子，

也可能是你的女儿。

无论怎样，你都必须准备好。

我父亲认为这和他没有关系。

你猜怎么着？

这确实有关系。

12:21

(Laughter)

12:23

如果你在这个地球上，

你就是跨性别故事的一部分。

你需要准备好成为Leah。

你有能力通过想象超过两个框的空间，

男性或女性，帮助某人。

你有能力创造安全的环境，

无论他们检查的哪个框是否是某人最重要的部分。

你有能力教育他人和自己。

你有能力弥合那些差距。

你有能力。

13:02

Thank you.

13:03

(Applause)
