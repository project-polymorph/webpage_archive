快乐是人们日常生活中的一个重要元素，社会学家对此一直没有充分研究。对于关于跨性别者的学术研究尤其如此。为了解决我们所说的社会学中的快乐缺陷，我们分析了对跨性别者的 40 次深度访谈，在访谈中他们被问及他们对成为跨性别者感到高兴的是什么。他们的回答证明了询问快乐的方法和理论的重要性。采访中出现了四个主要主题。首先，受访者轻松回答了关于快乐的问题。其次，与普遍的假设相反，我们发现跨性别者对成为边缘化群体的成员表示高兴，并表示他们更喜欢成为跨性别者。第三，接受边缘化身份使他们的生活质量提高，增加自信，身体积极性，和平静的感觉。最后，来自边缘化群体有助于与他人建立有意义的联系。我们的研究结果表明，迫切需要解决社会学研究中存在的关于跨性别者和更普遍的边缘化群体的快乐缺陷。我们将知识社会学和叙事社会学联系起来，展示了强调快乐如何为理解边缘化人群的生活经历提供细微差别，而这在许多社会学研究中都没有出现。

**Reducing the Joy Deficit in Sociology: A Study of Transgender Joy**  
Joy is a crucial element of people’s everyday lives that has been understudied by sociologists. This is particularly true for scholarship about transgender people. To address what we term a joy deficit in sociology, we analyze 40 in-depth interviews with trans people in which they were asked what they find joyful about being trans. Their responses demonstrate the methodological and theoretical importance of asking about joy. Four main themes emerged from the interviews. First, interviewees easily answered the question about joy. Second, contrary to common assumptions, we found that transgender people expressed joy in being members of a marginalized group and said that they preferred being transgender. Third, embracing a marginalized identity caused the quality of their lives to improve, increasing self-confidence, body positivity, and sense of peace. Finally, being from a marginalized group facilitated meaningful connections with other people. Our findings demonstrate a vital need to address the joy deficit that exists in the sociological scholarship on transgender people specifically, and marginalized groups more generally. Bridging the sociology of knowledge and narratives, we show how accentuating joy offers nuance to understandings of the lived experiences of marginalized people that has been absent from much of sociological scholarship.
