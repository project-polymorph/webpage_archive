**背景：** 青少年比其他年龄组更频繁地使用社交媒体。社交媒体被描述为女同性恋、男同性恋、双性恋、跨性别和酷儿和/或质疑 (LGBTQ) 青少年的安全环境。作为调查社交网络与性机构之间关联的混合方法研究的一部分，我们提出了关于 LGBTQ 青少年如何在线连接以形成支持网络的定性研究结果。

**方法：** 我们在纵向社交网络和代理项目中招募了 30 名 14-17 岁的青少年，他们根据性别或吸引力确定为 LGBTQ。半结构化访谈在澳大利亚各地在线或面对面进行。主题分析用于探索参与者对社交媒体使用和关系的看法和经验。

**结果：** 确定了两个首要主题：LGBTQ 青少年使用社交媒体来获得身份、关系和幸福支持。社交媒体并不总是不受 LGBTQ 青少年的歧视。许多 LGBTQ 参与者加入 Facebook 群组以与 LGBTQ 同龄人联系。Facebook 被认为是对那些有自杀念头等心理健康问题的人的重要支持。参与者给予和接受小组成员的支持，这被认为对那些感到孤立或受害的人很有用。LGBTQ 青少年建立了友谊、浪漫关系，并从这些群体中获得了有关性、关系和性健康的信息。参与者描述了负面经历，包括 Facebook 群组内的歧视、管理不善的群组以及暴露于反 LGBTQ 情绪。

**结论：** 社交媒体是 LGBTQ 青少年可以相互联系、教育和支持的环境，这可能对这个边缘化群体产生有益影响。社交媒体仍然存在问题，包括对 LGBTQ 社区和在其内部的歧视。

**Social media’s role in support networks among LGBTQ adolescents: a qualitative study**

**Background:** Adolescents use social media more frequently than other age groups. Social media has been described as a safe environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer and/or questioning (LGBTQ) adolescents. As part of mixed-methods research investigating the association between social networks and sexual agency, we present qualitative findings on how LGBTQ adolescents connect online to form support networks.

**Methods:** We recruited 30 adolescents aged 14–17 years who identified as LGBTQ in terms of their gender or attraction in the longitudinal Social Networks and Agency Project. Semi-structured interviews were conducted online or face-to-face across Australia. Thematic analysis was used to explore perceptions and experiences of participants in relation to social media use and relationships.

**Results:** Two overarching themes were identified: LGBTQ adolescents use social media for identity, relationships and wellbeing support. Social media is not always free of discrimination for LGBTQ adolescents. Many LGBTQ participants joined Facebook groups to connect with LGBTQ peers. Facebook was considered a vital support for those with mental health concerns including suicidal ideation. Participants gave and received support from group members, which was considered useful for those feeling isolated or victimised. LGBTQ adolescents formed friendships, romantic relationships and gained information on sex, relationships, and sexual health from these groups. Participants described negative experiences including discrimination within Facebook groups, mismanaged groups and exposure to anti-LGBTQ sentiments.

**Conclusion:** Social media is an environment where LGBTQ adolescents can connect, educate and support each other, which may have beneficial effects for this marginalised group. There remain issues with social media including discrimination against and within LGBTQ communities.
