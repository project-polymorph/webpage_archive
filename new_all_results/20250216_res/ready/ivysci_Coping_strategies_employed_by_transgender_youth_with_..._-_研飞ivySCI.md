**Abstract**

Understanding transgender youth coping mechanisms may help create strategies that reduce the influence of stress on quality of life. Our study aims to measure the quality of life of Brazilian transgender youth and analyse the association with their coping strategies used for dealing with general and gender‐related stress. The sample consisted of 185 participants ( μ = 18.49 years; SD 2.42); of which 95 (46.34%) transgender boys, 45 (21.95%) transgender girls, 65 (31.71%) non‐binary. Better quality of life was related to social support, whereas lower quality of life was related to the use of avoidance coping style in the context of general stress. The study found no association between coping strategies for gender‐related stress and quality of life. Thus, the increase in quality of life in the context of gender distress among transgender youth should involve other mechanisms than promoting coping skills.
