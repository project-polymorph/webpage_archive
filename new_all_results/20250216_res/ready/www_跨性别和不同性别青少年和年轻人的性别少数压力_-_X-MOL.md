性别少数群体压力是指性别少数群体所遭受的社会压力源，例如歧视和耻辱。本研究探讨了性别少数群体压力与跨性别和性别多元年轻人（TGDYP）心理健康之间的关系。我们使用横断面设计来调查 16-25 岁 TGDYP 中性别少数群体压力与心理健康之间的关系。我们测量了顺性别（_n_ = 135）和跨性别和性别多元化（TGD）（_n_ = 106）参与者的焦虑、抑郁、一般心理健康、性别焦虑、性别少数压力（远端和近端）、韧性和异性恋观念。分层回归用于分析数据。与顺性别参与者相比，TGD 参与者的焦虑和抑郁水平明显更高，总体健康状况更差。虽然通过我们的分析无法确定关系的方向，但经历更多少数族裔压力并在出生时被分配为女性的 TGD 参与者的抑郁和焦虑水平更高。具有较高弹性评分并在出生时被分配为男性的 TGD 参与者总体健康状况更好。我们的研究结果表明，我们在考虑如何减少 TGDYP 中的焦虑和抑郁时应该关注少数群体的压力。改善福祉的责任不仅在于服务，而应由我们整个社会承担。

**Gender minority stress in trans and gender diverse adolescents and young people**

Gender minority stress refers to social stressors such as discrimination and stigma that gender minorities are subject to. This study examines the relationship between gender minority stress and psychological well-being in trans and gender diverse young people (TGDYP). We used a cross-sectional design to investigate the relationship between gender minority stress and mental well-being in TGDYP aged 16–25. We measured anxiety, depression, general psychological well-being, gender dysphoria, gender minority stress (distal and proximal), resilience and heteronormative beliefs in cisgender (_n_ = 135) and trans and gender diverse (TGD) (_n_ = 106) participants. Hierarchical regression was used to analyse the data. TGD participants had significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression, and poorer general well-being, than cisgender participants. Although the direction of the relationship cannot be determined through our analysis, TGD participants who experienced more minority stress and were assigned female at birth had higher levels of depression and anxiety. TGD participants with higher resilience scores and were assigned male at birth had better well-being overall. Our findings suggest that we should pay attention to minority stress when thinking about how to reduce anxiety and depression in TGDYP. The responsibility for improving well-being lies not just with services but instead should be held by our whole society.
