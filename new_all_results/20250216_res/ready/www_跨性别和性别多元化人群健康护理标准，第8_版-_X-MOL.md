**摘要**

**_背景：_**跨性别医疗保健是一个快速发展的跨学科领域。在过去十年中，寻求支持和性别确认医疗的跨性别和性别多元化 (TGD) 人群的数量和知名度空前增加，同时该领域的科学文献也显着增加。世界跨性别健康专业协会 (WPATH) 是一个国际性、多学科的专业协会，其使命是促进基于证据的护理、教育、研究、公共政策和对跨性别健康的尊重。WPATH 的主要职能之一是通过护理标准 (SOC) 为 TGD 人促进最高标准的医疗保健。SOC 最初于 1979 年开发，最后一个版本（SOC-7）于 2012 年发布。

**_目标：_** SOC-8 的总体目标是为医疗保健专业人员 (HCP) 提供临床指导，以帮助 TGD 人获得安全有效的途径，以实现对性别自我的持久个人舒适，从而优化他们的整体身体健康，心理健康，自我实现。

**_方法：_** SOC-8 基于跨性别健康方面的最佳科学和专家专业共识。国际专业人士和利益相关者被选为 SOC-8 委员会成员。推荐声明是根据来自独立系统文献综述（如果有的话）、背景综述和专家意见的数据制定的。建议的分级基于支持干预措施的现有证据、风险和危害的讨论，以及在不同背景和国家背景下的可行性和可接受性。

**_结果：_**作为 SOC-8 的一部分，总共开发了 18 个章节。它们包含对为 TGD 患者提供护理和治疗的医疗保健专业人员的建议。每条建议后面都附有带有相关参考资料的解释性文字。术语、全球适用性、人口估计和教育章节涵盖了与跨性别健康相关的一般领域。为不同的 TGD 人群开发的章节包括对成人、青少年、儿童、非二元、太监和双性人以及生活在机构环境中的人的评估。最后，与性别确认治疗相关的章节是激素治疗、手术和术后护理、语音和交流、初级保健、生殖健康、性健康和心理健康。

**_结论：_** SOC-8 指南旨在灵活地满足全球 TGD 人群的各种医疗保健需求。虽然适应性强，但它们提供了促进最佳医疗保健的标准，并为性别不一致的人的治疗提供了指导。与 SOC 的所有先前版本一样，本文件中规定的性别确认医疗干预标准是临床指南；个人医疗保健专业人员和计划可能会在与 TGD 人员协商后修改这些内容。

**Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, Version 8**

**Abstract**

**_Background:_** Transgender healthcare is a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field. In the last decade, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number and visibility of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people seeking support and gender-affirming medical treatment in parallel with a significant rise in the scientific literature in this area. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) is an international, multidisciplinary, professional association whose mission is to promote evidence-based care, education, research, public policy, and respect in transgender health. One of the main functions of WPATH is to promote the highest standards of health care for TGD people through the Standards of Care (SOC). The SOC was initially developed in 1979 and the last version (SOC-7) was published in 2012. In view of the increasing scientific evidence, WPATH commissioned a new version of the Standards of Care, the SOC-8.

**_Aim:_** The overall goal of SOC-8 is to provide health care professionals (HCPs) with clinical guidance to assist TGD people in accessing safe and effective pathways to achieving lasting personal comfort with their gendered selves with the aim of optimizing their overall physical health, psychological well-being, and self-fulfillment.

**_Methods:_** The SOC-8 is based on the best available science and expert professional consensus in transgender health. International professionals and stakeholders were selected to serve on the SOC-8 committee. Recommendation statements were developed based on data derived from independent systematic literature reviews, where available, background reviews and expert opinions. Grading of recommendations was based on the available evidence supporting interventions, a discussion of risks and harms, as well as the feasibility and acceptability within different contexts and country settings.

**_Results:_** A total of 18 chapters were developed as part of the SOC-8. They contain recommendations for health care professionals who provide care and treatment for TGD people. Each of the recommendations is followed by explanatory text with relevant references. General areas related to transgender health are covered in the chapters Terminology, Global Applicability, Population Estimates, and Education. The chapters developed for the diverse population of TGD people include Assessment of Adults, Adolescents, Children, Nonbinary, Eunuchs, and Intersex Individuals, and people living in Institutional Environments. Finally, the chapters related to gender-affirming treatment are Hormone Therapy, Surgery and Postoperative Care, Voice and Communication, Primary Care, Reproductive Health, Sexual Health, and Mental Health.

**_Conclusions:_** The SOC-8 guidelines are intended to be flexible to meet the diverse health care needs of TGD people globally. While adaptable, they offer standards for promoting optimal health care and guidance for the treatment of people experiencing gender incongruence. As in all previous versions of the SOC, the criteria set forth in this document for gender-affirming medical interventions are clinical guidelines; individual health care professionals and programs may modify these in consultation with the TGD person.
