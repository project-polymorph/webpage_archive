《变性人尊重、代理和尊严法案》(TRADA) (2020) 标志着加州惩教与康复部对被监禁的变性人的反应发生了巨大的程序转变。事实上，TRADA 试图显着减少受害并扩大被监禁的跨性别者的权利，迫使惩教人员 (CO) 在做出住房决定时“认真考虑”“对健康和安全的看法”，尊重并始终使用适当的代词对被监禁的跨性别者的尊称，并在搜身政策方面尊重个人的性别认同。 TRADA 有可能对跨性别囚犯非常有利，但它可以被解释为在实践和意识形态上对 CO 的反对。因此，对 CO 的态度、意见和信念进行评估，以及类似的政策，可以为监狱改革的立法尝试如何在基层发挥作用提供宝贵的见解。本文报道了一位被监禁的跨性别学者进行的一项原创研究，探讨了 CO 的跨性别恐惧症意识形态整合如何影响他们对直接影响跨性别囚犯的政策的同意和解释。

**Interpretive Harms and Contested Agency: Transphobic Ideology, Correctional Officers, and the Law**

The Transgender Respect, Agency, and Dignity Act (TRADA) (2020), marks a drastic procedural turn in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s response to incarcerated transgender people. TRADA, in fact, attempts to significantly reduce victimization and expand the rights of incarcerated transgender people, compelling correctional officers (COs) to give “serious consideration” to “perceptions of health and safety” when making housing decisions, honor and consistently use proper pronouns and honorifics for incarcerated trans people, and respect a person’s gender identity in regard to body search policies. Where TRADA has the potential to be quite beneficial for trans prisoners, it could be interpreted as adversarial toward COs, both in practice and ideologically. For this reason, the evaluation of COs’ attitudes, opinions, and beliefs concerning TRADA, and policies like it, could provide valuable insight on how legislative attempts at prison reform play out on the ground level. Reporting on an original study conducted by an incarcerated trans scholar, this article examines how COs’ transphobic ideological conformities influence their agreement with, and interpretation of, policies which directly affect transgender prisoners.
