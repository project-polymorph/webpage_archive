2015年，美国的婚姻平等是同性恋运动的一大胜利。然而，婚姻平等作为运动的主要焦点，并非没有批评，特别是作为一个主要影响白人、同性恋、经济上有保障的个人的问题。鉴于运动的历史，有必要问下一步是什么。年轻的酷儿和跨性别者代表了下一代潜在的激进分子和同性恋和跨性别解放的倡导者，但很少有经验关注他们的运动目标和积极参与的动机，特别是在农村保守国家的年轻人中。因此，本研究试图了解酷儿和跨性别年轻人（18-29 岁）认为重要的社会、经济和环境问题，以及他们参与激进主义努力的动机。数据来自混合方法计划评估，该评估展示了导致研究参与者（n = 65）在美国一个保守的、高度农村的西南州积极行动的问题和动机。根据理论和实证文献讨论了这项研究的结果，然后提供了对酷儿和跨性别运动、活动家和组织者的影响。

**Activism in Southwestern Queer and Trans Young Adults After the Marriage Equality Era** In 2015, marriage equality in the United States was a big win for the gay and lesbian movement. Marriage equality as a primary focus of the movement, however, was not without its critiques, particularly as an issue affecting mostly white, gay, economically secure individuals. Given the history of the movement, it is essential to ask what is next. Young queer and trans people represent the next generation of potential activists and advocates for queer and trans liberation, yet little empirical attention has been paid to their goals for the movement and motivations to be actively involved, particularly among young adults in rural, conservative states. Therefore, this study sought to understand the social, economic, and environmental issues deemed important by queer and trans young adults (aged 18–29), as well as their motivations to get involved in activism efforts. Data came from a mixed-methods program evaluation, which presents a picture of the issues and motivations that led study participants (n = 65) toward activism in one conservative, highly rural, Southwestern state in the United States. The findings of this study are discussed in light of theoretical and empirical literature and then implications for the queer and trans movement, activists, and organizers are offered.
