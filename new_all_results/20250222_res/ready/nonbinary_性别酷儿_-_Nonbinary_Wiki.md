_非二元性别者面临着一种真正的压力，他们需要展现出对自身身份的绝对安全感和确定性。你必须始终表现出自信，这样才不会有人有机会质疑你的性别。我认为这真的很糟糕，因为我们可能会把过多的重视放在确定性上，而不是探索上。我们唯一可以脆弱的时候是和其他酷儿在一起，他们理解性别是一个旅程和一个过程。_

**性别酷儿**（Genderqueer），也叫做**GenderQueer**或**gender queer**，是一个伞式术语，既指代非常规的[性别认同](/wiki/Gender_Identity "Gender Identity")也指代非常规的[性别表达](/wiki/Gender_Expression "Gender Expression")。这个标签也可能会由希望认同自己坚持的酷儿性或非常规性别，但不具体表达其性别内涵的个体所使用。

作为一个伞式术语，性别酷儿和[非二元性别](/wiki/Nonbinary "Nonbinary")涵盖的范围类似，很多认同为非二元的个体也会认为自己是性别酷儿。不过，两个术语有不同的历史范围和含义。“性别酷儿”这个词要比“非二元”的应用早至少十年。

## 历史

Genderqueer was coined in the 1990s as 'Gender Queer,' and was for a time written as 'GenderQueer' before becoming a single word. The original meaning was literally queer gender, including anyone who felt the way they experienced or expressed gender was queer. The term carries the non-normative and anti-assimilationist connotations of the [Queer Movement](/index.php?title=Queer_Movement&action=edit&redlink=1 "Queer Movement (page does not exist)") and applies these to gender rather than sexuality.

A 1990 book titled "The Welcoming Congregation Handbook" defined "Gender Queer" as "A person whose understanding of her/hir/his gender identification transcends society's polarized gender system".[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)

Another early usage of the term was by [Riki Anne Wilchins](/wiki/Riki_Anne_Wilchins "Riki Anne Wilchins") in the Spring 1995 newsletter of [Transexual Menace](/index.php?title=Transexual_Menace&action=edit&redlink=1 "Transexual Menace (page does not exist)"):

«

...this is not just one more civil rights struggle for one more narrowly-defined minority. It's about all of us who are genderqueer: diesel [dykes](/wiki/Dyke "Dyke") and [stone butches](/wiki/Stone_butch "Stone butch"), leatherqueens and radical fairies, nelly fags, [crossdressers](/wiki/Crossdressing "Crossdressing"), [intersexed](/wiki/Intersex "Intersex"), [transsexuals](/wiki/Transsexual "Transsexual"), [transvestites](/wiki/Transvestite "Transvestite"), [transgendered](/wiki/Transgender "Transgender"), transgressively gendered, and those of us whose gender expressions are so complex they haven’t even been named yet.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)

[Riki Wilchins' essay](http://www.myhusbandbetty.com/2003/10/19/riki-wilchins-on-the-tg-spectrum/) from the 2002 anthology _[GenderQueer](/wiki/Books "Books")_ describes how the original 'Gender Queers' adopted the label because the intended-to-be-inclusive umbrella term [transgender](/wiki/Transgender "Transgender") had begun to be most strongly associated with [transsexual](/wiki/Transsexual "Transsexual"), [gender binary](/wiki/Gender_binary "Gender binary") identified and medically [transitioning](/wiki/Transition "Transition") people, pushing out those who did not fit this dominant [transgender narrative](/index.php?title=Transgender_narrative&action=edit&redlink=1 "Transgender narrative (page does not exist)").

By 1999/2000, online communities such as the [Sphere mailing list](/wiki/Sphere_mailing_list "Sphere mailing list") were using the term genderqueer as an umbrella to unite a number of [nonbinary](/wiki/Nonbinary "Nonbinary") gender identities and identifications that are now thought of as under the nonbinary umbrella. Over the next decade, genderqueer developed as a standalone identity with particular (sub)cultural expectations and connotations, while the tendency to identify particular experiences under its umbrella seemed to diminish. However both uses are still visible in different online and in person communities.

## 性别酷儿和非二元性别的区别

Genderqueer means non-normative or _queer_ gender while [nonbinary](/wiki/Nonbinary "Nonbinary") means gender that falls outside the [gender binary](/wiki/Gender_binary "Gender binary") model. Both of these terms are extremely similar in scope, however in practice their connotations are significantly different.

Genderqueer comes with the anti-assimilationist political connotations of [queer](/wiki/Queer "Queer"), which is a reclaimed slur word with strong associations with a countercultural sexuality movement that sets itself apart from the mainstream [LGBT](/wiki/LGBT "LGBT") community. (Note that the word "queer" is still actively used as a pejorative and hate speech in many regions.) As such genderqueer implies a similar counterculture, setting itself apart from mainstream [transgender](/wiki/Transgender "Transgender") discourse. Most genderqueer people also consider themselves to be queer and there is a strong trend of rejecting the gender binary and normative [gender roles](/wiki/Gender_roles "Gender roles") with in the Queer Movement as a whole.

By contrast, nonbinary is more politically neutral in its connotations. Nonbinary was coined as a descriptive term, originally simply 'nonbinary gender', used to describe the range of experiences that fall outside of the binary gender model. There is no countercultural anti-transgender discourse connotation, nor is there a connotation of association with the wider Queer Movement. Nonbinary is intended to simply cover the widest range of identities and experiences without intending to describe their political or cultural philosophies and affiliations.

### 观察到的使用这两种不同身份的人群间的区别

While genderqueer and nonbinary are theoretically extremely similar in their scope as umbrella terms, in practice genderqueer slants more towards those who identify as queering gender while nonbinary tends to attract those who hold specific [trans\*](/wiki/Trans* "Trans*") or [transgender](/wiki/Transgender "Transgender") identities that fall outside of the gender binary.

Genderqueer-identified people seem to be more likely to hold [binary gender](/wiki/Binary_gender "Binary gender") identities (eg, 'Genderqueer Woman') while considering their [gender expression](/wiki/Gender_expression "Gender expression") or [gender performance](/index.php?title=Gender_performance&action=edit&redlink=1 "Gender performance (page does not exist)") to be queer or non-normative, while nonbinary-identified people are more likely to consider their [gender identity](/wiki/Gender_identity "Gender identity") (or lack of gender identity) to fall outside of the binary.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Category:Citation_needed "Category:Citation needed")_\] Genderqueer-identified people seem to be more likely to consider themselves to be queer or a member of the queer community.

Nonbinary-identified people generally seem more comfortable with considering themselves transgender and more likely to use the language of [gender dysphoria](/wiki/Gender_dysphoria "Gender dysphoria"). The adoption of the term 'nonbinary' by parts of the genderqueer community may reflect a trend of adopting the language of the transgender rights movement in order to make use of and expand on the legal protections now afforded to transgender people in some localities. Nonbinary-identified people may be more likely to be seeking access to transgender medical care or legal recognition (aka [transition](/wiki/Transition "Transition")).

Some nonbinary people reject the term genderqueer as an umbrella term because they are offended to be associated with queer sexuality, or still see queer as an offensive word.

Despite these trends and connotations, both terms are used by some members of each group and so may be considered as wide inclusive umbrella terms. Some genderqueer-identified people have sought 'transition', some nonbinary-identified people hold binary gender identities and consider themselves to be nonbinary by gender expression, and it is currently common for nonbinary-identified individuals to also identify as genderqueer (especially as this term predates nonbinary by at least a decade).\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Category:Citation_needed "Category:Citation needed")_\]

## 性别酷儿是跨性别吗？

There is controversy within the genderqueer community over whether genderqueer people fall under the [transgender](/wiki/Transgender "Transgender") umbrella. Despite the work of [Leslie Feinberg](/wiki/Leslie_Feinberg "Leslie Feinberg") in the 1990s to coin transgender as a wide and inclusive umbrella term covering all forms of _transgressive gender_, the term genderqueer developed out of a frustration with the association between transgender and [transsexualism](/wiki/Transsexual "Transsexual"), [gender dysphoria](/wiki/Gender_dysphoria "Gender dysphoria") and the dominant [transgender narrative](/index.php?title=Transgender_narrative&action=edit&redlink=1 "Transgender narrative (page does not exist)").\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Category:Citation_needed "Category:Citation needed")_\]

It is common for genderqueer-identified people to consider trans and [transgender](/wiki/Transgender "Transgender") to be synonymous with [transition](/wiki/Transition "Transition") and so to claim genderqueer as a non-transgender identity. This is especially true with people who are genderqueer by gender expression only, but also applies to some genderqueer people who are comfortable with their body and see transgender as synonymous with bodily gender dysphoria.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Category:Citation_needed "Category:Citation needed")_\] As such, it is important when talking about genderqueer and nonbinary people to recognise that not all people who hold these identities consider themselves to fall under the transgender umbrella.
