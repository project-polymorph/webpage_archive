摘要 川普阵营再遭重创。川普的铁友马斯克或有大的麻烦：马斯克与普金经常联系。与马斯克紧密合作的美国航天局呼吁调查马斯克！若对美国安全造成威胁，马斯克恐怕得进班房啊！看来马斯克支持川普又多了一个理由，指望川普当选后特赦他。

马斯克与普金关系曝光 《华尔街日报》报道指出，马斯克与普京讨论了“个人话题、商业和地缘政治紧张局势（personal topics, business and geopolitical tensions）”，这引发了国家安全担忧，因为SpaceX与NASA和美国军方的合作可能让马斯克接触到敏感的政府信息和美国情报。 https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/musk-putin-secret-conversations-37e1c187

《华尔街日报》报道及各方反应 《华尔街日报》报道，马斯克自2022年底以来与俄罗斯总统普京“保持定期联系（Musk and Putin have spoken regularly）”。

一些美国官员在过去一年中对马斯克与俄罗斯等美国对手的互动提出了反间谍担忧，而美国情报界对调查此事持谨慎态度，因为马斯克是美国公民。

多位白宫官员向《华尔街日报》表示，他们并不知晓马斯克与普京的接触，且报道指出，这些谈话“似乎在政府内部是一个高度保密的秘密（appears to be a closely held secret in government）。”然而，这些谈话内容由多名现任和前任的美欧及俄罗斯官员向《华尔街日报》证实。

马斯克未回应《华尔街日报》的置评请求。

国家安全委员会发言人约翰·柯比周五表示，他看到了相关报道，但白宫“无法证实”报道内容，并建议将问题转向马斯克。五角大楼发言人对《华尔街日报》表示，国防部不会就“任何个人的安全许可、审查或状态，或在涉及任何个人行动的报道中的人员安全政策问题（any individual’s security clearance, review or status, or about personnel security policy matters in the context of reports about any individual’s actions）”发表评论。

克里姆林宫发言人对该报称，马斯克和普京只进行过一次电话交谈，讨论了“太空及未来技术等话题（space as well as current and future technologies）。”

马斯克在乌克兰冲突中扮演了关键角色 自2022年初俄罗斯入侵乌克兰以来，马斯克对乌克兰的支持——以SpaceX提供星链（Starlink）服务为例——有所减弱，他关于冲突的公开言论越来越与特朗普的观点一致。特朗普曾表示，他会迅速谈判结束战争。马斯克公司的卫星互联网终端为乌克兰军方提供了重要的通信支持，使其即便在移动通信和互联网网络被摧毁的情况下，依然能够进行作战和保持联系。

在马斯克最初高调支持乌克兰后，SpaceX突然要求五角大楼每月支付数千万美元以资助乌克兰的星链服务，从而减轻SpaceX的负担。对此报道，马斯克随后在推特上突然宣布撤回了资金请求。与此同时，马斯克在社交媒体X上发起了一项投票，提出了一项“乌克兰\-俄罗斯和平”计划，内容包括在联合国监督下重新进行在俄罗斯最近非法吞并的地区的选举。在乌克兰总统泽伦斯基质疑马斯克在战争中的立场后，这位科技企业家回应称，他“仍然非常支持乌克兰”，但担心“大规模升级”。

SpaceX之前将其星链信号限制在乌克兰控制的地区，这限制了依赖星链通信的潜在进攻。随后，SpaceX扩大了信号覆盖范围至全国，其间，乌克兰国防情报机构声称确认俄罗斯军队在被占领地区使用星链卫星通信。俄罗斯似乎通过第三方购买这些终端；SpaceX表示，它与俄罗斯政府或其军方没有任何业务往来，其服务在俄罗斯无法使用。这一声明没有说明在被占领的乌克兰地区是否能使用。

马斯克去年没有批准乌克兰请求，在克里米亚海岸附近开启其公司的星链卫星通信网络。这显然干扰了乌克兰对俄罗斯海军舰队的突袭。

根据传记作家艾萨克森的说法，马斯克的决定使得乌克兰官员求他重新开启卫星，源于对俄罗斯可能会以核武器回应乌克兰对克里米亚攻击的强烈担忧，这种担忧是通过马斯克与俄罗斯高级官员的对话进一步加深的。

在2022年10月，马斯克否认了美国政治学家伊恩·布雷默（Ian Bremmer）关于他与普京就战争及结束冲突的“和平划”进行对话的说法。

对美国安全的威胁 美国航天局的局长尼尔森在认为应该展开调查。如果确实存在马斯克与俄罗斯总统的多次对话，那将令人担忧，尤其是对于NASA、国防部和一些情报机构来说。可能严重危害美国国家安全。

对川普阵营是一次重创？ 马斯克对川普的支持，世人皆知。他在十月向一个致力于让特朗普重返白宫的超级政治行动委员会（super PAC）注入了近4400万美元，使得他对该组织的总捐款接近1.19亿美元，并且他在本月早些时候在宾夕法尼亚州巴特勒的竞选活动中与特朗普同台亮相。

最近，马斯克还为摇摆州的选民提供了高达每天100万美元的抽奖活动，这引起了美国司法部的关注。尽管美国司法部警告称，这些付款可能是非法的，马斯克的超级政治行动委员会（super PAC）在周四仍向密歇根州和威斯康星州的两名注册选民颁发了各100万美元的奖金。

马斯克与普金的丑闻在美国大选最后9天内曝光，是否对使得原本支持川普的中间选民改变决定，目前还不清楚。

但可以肯定的是，这件丑闻对川普阵营应该不是好消息。

马斯克确实不是个单纯的科技天才，他的抱负也不只是个世界首富！可能很多人都看走眼了！

教皇不是上帝。虽然我不去教会，圣经还是读了几遍滴。 看看圣经（上帝的话）怎么说： Leviticus 18:22 ~ You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. Romans 1:26-28 ~ For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. Genesis 2:24 - Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. Mark 10:6-9 ~ But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”

意大利天主教大教主 Vigano's OPEN LETTER TO AMERICAN CATHOLICS ON THE EVE OF THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 上帝对魔鬼的正邪大战 (民主党的LGBDQ 就是anti-God, 对上帝的公开蔑视和叫板) Dear Faithful American Catholics, I am addressing all of you, a few days before the Presidential Election that will call millions of American citizens to the polls. Even in conditions of relative normality, the exercise of the vote is your moral duty, through which you cooperate in the first person in choosing the person who will lead the Nation for the next four years. But in this coming electoral round – just as in 2020 and indeed much more so – you are not simply called to choose between two candidates who happen to be on different political sides but who both nevertheless have the common good at heart in compliance with the Constitution and the Law. No; in this election you must choose between two radically opposed ways of conceiving the government of your Nation: you are called to choose between democracy and dictatorship, between freedom and slavery. On one side we have candidate Donald J. Trump, who, despite serious problems in his positions – especially in the matter of abortion and assisted procreation – has as his objective the common good and the protection of the fundamental freedoms of citizens. In Donald Trump’s America, every Catholic can practice their Faith and educate their children in it without interference from the State. On the other side we have a candidate and a party that promotes everything that directly opposes the Faith and Morals of the Catholic Church. In Kamala Harris’ America, Catholics – but also Protestants – are considered fundamentalists to be marginalized and eliminated, and their children are considered the property of the State, which arrogates to itself the right to lead them astray from an early age in both body and soul. Trump’s America can become great and prosperous again. Harris’ America is destined for invasion and for moral, social, and economic destruction: the most ferocious dictatorship. Look at your country! Your cities have become dumps filled with derelicts and criminals, drug dealers and addicts, prostitutes and robbers. Your schools are dens of indoctrination and corruption from kindergarten onwards. In your courts, criminals are acquitted and innocents are imprisoned: new ideological crimes are prosecuted, while illegality is tolerated and encouraged. In your hospitals, multinational corporations rule, and you are their guinea pigs to be exterminated or made chronically ill so that you will be their perpetual clients. Farmers, ranchers, and fishermen are persecuted and forced to fail, while the land is grabbed by unscrupulous corporations who transform it into endless photovoltaic systems and wind turbines to power their data centers and server farms where they collect all your data, your movements, your purchases, and your political preferences. They have gone so far as to tamper with the climate by means of sophisticated geoengineering operations and devastating arson in order to make the global warming fraud credible and impose the green transition, the increase in the cost of energy, and electric cars and scooters. And all this is done based on evidence that consists of lies without any scientific proof, but which are propagated through the servile collaboration of the regime media, ever ready to label any dissenters as conspiracy theorists. But what until yesterday was dismissed as the result of conspiracy theories is now admitted by the government itself. They takeaway your sunlight; they poison you by seeding the clouds; they overwhelm your villages and your fields with deadly hurricanes; they kill your livestock and dry up your crops with induced droughts and devastating fires. They aim to control the entire food sector, to force you to eat only what they make available to you. This is what the Agenda 2030 calls for, which has been imposed without any vote by the United Nations and the World Economic Forum. In these four disastrous years of the Biden-Harris administration, we have had a puppet in the White House and a corrupt and incompetent Vice President who has never stopped lying and deceiving voters about her past and her future. Power is managed by the criminal deep state – whose names and faces we now know – that is responsible for the destruction of your great Nation. And to ensure that the crisis is endless, new war scenarios are continually opening up, in conflicts that no one actually wants, except for those who make enormous profits from them, sacrificing human lives and compromising international stability. You have seen what the Democrats, that is, the woke far Left, have been capable of in four years. Imagine what they will be able to do if, instead of Biden’s numerous stand-ins, his Vice President is elected – in the most scandalous and unimaginable fraud – with her entourage of LGBTQ+ Ministers, rigorously woke, sold out to China or the World Economic Forum, sponsored by George Soros or Bill Gates, manipulated by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. At that point, dear American Catholics, you will not only have to go to a different rally – as Kamala would like – in order to say “Christ is the Lord”, because saying that will be considered hate speech, and praying in front of an abortion clinic an act of terrorism. Do not think that these are remote hypotheses: wherever the woke Left takes power, it establishes the most vicious, anti-human, and anti-Christian dictatorship that humanity has ever known. And we know that every time the Left has come to power, it has never left through democratic means. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris: we are not talking about two visions that are a bit different but still part of the normal political back-and-forth. No; we are talking about two diametrically opposed and irreconcilable worlds, in which Trump fights against the deep state and is committed to freeing America from its tentacled grip, while on the opposite side we have a corrupt and blackmailed candidate, an organic part of the deep state, who acts as a puppet in the hands of warmongers like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, of self-proclaimed “philanthropists” like the criminals George Soros and Klaus Schwab, or of characters like Jeffrey Epstein and Sean Combs. Their program is that of the Global Left, the World Economic Forum, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and ultimately the program of Vanguard, BlackRock, and StateStreet. Their agenda is dictated by the financial oligarchy that controls humanity to the detriment of the people: an elite that operates not only in the United States but also in Canada, Australia, Europe, and wherever politics is held hostage by their investment funds and their pseudo-humanitarian organizations dedicated to the obliteration of Western Civilization. Behind these people – by now we should know this – are people devoted to evil, united by the satanic hatred against Our Lord Jesus Christ and those who believe in Him, mainly against the Catholic faithful. We want Christ to reign, and we proclaim it with pride: Christ is King! They want the Antichrist to reign, whose tyranny is made of chaos, war, disease, famine, and death. And the more emergencies and crises planned and created by the globalist elite increase, the more that elite has a pretext to impose new limitations, new restrictions of fundamental rights, and new social controls. Joe Biden, the current “President,” is a servant of this subversive elite and widely blackmailable for the scandals and crimes committed by himself personally and also by his family, beginning with his son Hunter. His “Vice President,” Kamala Harris, is equally subservient to the same deep state. And the Democratic Party, to which they both belong, is the expression of the woke ideology that plagues all the parties of the global Left. Candidate Donald J. Trump, while certainly taking some serious critical positions that a Catholic cannot agree with, represents for us, dear American faithful, in this specific historical moment, the only possible choice to counter the globalist coup that the woke Left is about to implement definitively, irreparably, and with incalculable damage for future generations. Voting for Donald Trump means firmly distancing ourselves from an anti-Catholic, anti-Christian and anti-human vision of society. It means stopping those who want to create a hellish dystopia that is even worse than the one announced by George Orwell. And it also means – do not forget – giving him our vote of confidence, so that President Trump knows that the massive vote of Catholics and Christians that brought him back to the White House must become the premise for a more incisive commitment to the defense of life from conception to natural death, the traditional family, the right of parents to educate their children, and to the defense of the Christian Faith and the cultural identity of the Nation. I repeat: the choice is between a conservative President, who is paying with his very life for his fight against the deep state, and an infernal monster who obeys Satan. For a Catholic, there can be no question: voting for Kamala Harris is morally inadmissible and constitutes a very grave sin. Nor is it morally possible to abstain, because in this war declaring oneself neutral means allying oneself with the enemy. People around the world are beginning to understand the threat that looms over them and their children’s future, and you Americans have understood it too. But even if this time it will be more difficult for the deep state to repeat the fraud of 2020, you must not think that it will resign itself to defeat so easily. Let us therefore prepare to prevent possible attacks and civil war scenarios from being used to impose martial law and new restrictions, after the attempts on his life from which President Trump providentially escaped. But let us not forget, dear Faithful, that human energies alone are powerless in the face of this infernal display of forces. We proclaim that Christ is King – this means that Our Lord must return to reign, and the first way to make Him reign is by obeying His holy Law and living in His Grace. Let Christ reign in your hearts, in your families, in your communities, and throughout the entire United States of America: this is the only way to peace, harmony, and prosperity for your Nation. Think of how many of you Catholics there are in the United States! Vote without hesitation, and pray that Our Lord will enlighten American citizens in making their choice and grant victory to those who, at least, have no problem proclaiming that Christ is Lord. May God bless you all, and may the Virgin of Guadalupe, she who is the Patroness of the United States and all the Americas, and Saint Michael the Archangel, protect you.
