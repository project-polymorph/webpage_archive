# Asia Pacific Transgender Network (APTN): Supporting Trans and Gender Diverse Rights in Asia Pacific

**Background:**

In the Asia and Pacific regions, trans and gender-diverse people continue to face stigma, discrimination, and criminalization of their identities. They endure various forms of violence, including conversion therapy and transphobic hate crimes, perpetrated by individuals, religious and political leaders, institutions, and state actors. These challenges place communities in vulnerable positions amid ongoing armed conflicts, \[…](https://www.weareaptn.org/2024/09/03/amplify-trans-advocacy-fellowship-open-call/)

## Our Work

Across Asia and the Pacific, trans and gender diverse people are denied fundamental human rights, from legal recognition to employment, housing and health services. This severely undermines their ability to live a fulfilling, healthy and dignified life. APTN, together with a range of partners, supports, organises and advocates for the advancement and protection of the rights of the trans and gender diverse people to live authentically and stay safe in the world. We work towards a society that respects the fundamental human rights of trans and gender diverse people, and upholds, respects, and protects their diversity, safety, equality and dignity.

## Where we work

APTN works across the Asia and the Pacific, home to more than one-half of the global population, a diverse region where countries have varying levels of human development. We work across the entire region to address the persistent binary gender norms and systemic patriarchy. We do so because the trans and gender diverse people continue to be marginalised and deprived of their rights, including their bodily rights.

Our aim is to build a robust, resilient and self-reliant community of trans and gender diverse people in Asia and the Pacific. We achieve this by working with local partners, community members and development agencies to co-create interventions, evidence-based programmes and initiatives at country, regional and global levels. We do this for trans and gender diverse people, policymakers, health care practitioners and providers, and international agencies. 

Here’s some of our projects and community partners:
