**背景：** 跨性别者属于社会上最受耻辱的群体之一。尽管已经对跨性别者的社会污名进行了许多次检查，但跨性别者中的过渡后污名经历受到了有限的研究关注。这项研究的目的是研究荷兰跨性别人士在其过渡后的污名化经历。

**方法：** 十名跨性别妇女（年龄：M = 58.50，SD = 9.49）和10名跨性别男人（年龄：M = 42.90，SD = 13.62）参加了面对面的半结构化访谈。扎根的理论被用来概念化和分析数据。我们研究了跨性别人士在过渡后所经历的正面和负面反应。此外，我们探讨了跨性别男人和跨性别女人之间的经验差异。最后，我们研究了顺式性别对男女跨性别者反应的差异。

**结果：** 参加者报告说，自过渡以来，其心理健康状况有所改善。但是，他们仍然经历了不同形式的污名化。跨性别女人似乎比跨性别男人遭受更强的社会污名。跨性别妇女在过渡后也经历了较低的社会地位。他们主要经历了顺性别男性的负面反应。与会者强调了社会和同伴支持的重要性。

**结论：** 目前的研究结果证明了过渡后存在污名化，并提出心理上的后顾之忧。社会和同伴的支持似乎对于应对污名化很重要，改善跨性别者的社交网络是有益的。

**Experiences with stigmatization among transgender individuals after transition: A qualitative study in the Netherlands.** Background: Transgender individuals belong to one of the most stigmatized groups in society. Although the social stigma of transgender individuals has been examined many times, post transition stigma experiences among transgender individuals have received limited research attention. The aim of this study was to examine experiences with stigmatization among Dutch transgender individuals after their transition. Method: Ten trans women (age: M = 58.50, SD = 9.49) and 10 trans men (age: M = 42.90, SD = 13.62) participated in face-to-face semistructured interviews. Grounded theory was used to conceptualize and analyze the data. We examined the positive and negative reactions that transgender individuals experienced in the period after their transition. Furthermore, we explored differences between experiences of trans men and trans women. Finally, we examined differences between cisgender men and women regarding their reactions toward transgender individuals. Results: Participants reported improved psychological well-being since transition. However, they still experienced different forms of stigmatization. Trans women appeared to experience stronger social stigma than trans men. Trans women also experienced lower social status after their transition. They mainly experienced negative responses from cisgender men. Participants emphasized the importance of social and peer support. Conclusion: The current study findings demonstrate the presence of stigmatization after transition and argue for psychological aftercare. Social and peer support appeared to be important for coping with stigmatization, and improving the social network of transgender individuals is beneficial. Health providers and researchers are recommended to promote the development of constructive coping skills for transgender individuals with interventions especially targeting trans women.
