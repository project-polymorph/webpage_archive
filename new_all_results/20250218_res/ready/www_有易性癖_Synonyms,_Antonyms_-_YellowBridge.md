## Chinese searches

-   Chinese handwriting recognizer. Click on the brush button to enter characters just by drawing them with the correct stroke order.
-   Stroke order animation. [Sample](character-stroke-order.php?word=%E7%94%B5%E8%84%91). In addition to the headword on _every page_ being animated, you can **trace** the correct stroke order inside a character outline as well as **write** the character using just your finger or a mouse depending on your device.
-   Your choice of simplified or traditional characters.
-   Wildcard matches for Chinese or pinyin (just enter * in place of zero or more Chinese characters or pinyin syllables).
-   Integrated with [character dictionary](character-dictionary.php) and etymology.

## English searches

-   Returns fewer, more relevant results compared to the competition.
-   _Did you mean?_ suggestions for likely typos.
-   Words found even if entered in conjugated or plural forms.

## All searches
