### 背景

关于阴道成形术的外科技术的报道很多。但是，经过仔细的审查后发现，除了很少有关于与所有不同技术相关的结果的报告外，还缺乏基于证据的数据。

### 目的

这项研究的目的是描述与变性女性阴道成形术相关的围手术期不良事件，并确定减少不良事件所需的阈值病例数。

### 学习规划

这是对三级护理中心接受阴道成形术以确认性别的所有妇女的回顾性研究。所有病例均由单板认证的女性骨盆医学和重建外科专家进行。如果可获得6个月的结果，则将女性包括在内。一旦确定患者，便收集围手术期数据。比较不同阈值病例数之间的不良事件和围手术期结果，以确定显着减少不良事件所需的病例数。对文献进行了先验性审查，以确定通常报告的不良事件的发生率，并将这些发生率用作确定复制这些报告的发生率所需的阈值病例数的参考框架。确定此阈值后，

### 结果

在2015年12月至2019年3月之间，进行了76例阴道成形术手术。所有患者均可获得六个月的结局数据。所有患者的平均年龄和体重指数为41（±17）岁和27.3（±5.1）kg / m 2, 分别。术前接受激素治疗的中位时间（范围）为36（12–360）个月，7.9％（6）的患者曾接受过睾丸切除术。在这些患者中，有83.4％（71）接受了全深度阴道成形术，而其余患者接受了零深度手术。中位（范围）手术时间为210（138–362）分钟。所有患者的中位（范围）随访为12.5（6-50）个月。所有患者的术中不良事件发生率为2.6％（95％置信区间为1.8-4.1），而术后即刻（<30天）和延迟（> 30天和<6个月）的发生率为19 ％（95％置信区间16.4-22.2）和25％（95％置信区间22.4-28.4）。50例患者的表现被确定为以临床和统计学上显着的方式减少不良事件的阈值。前50例手术后的手术时间较短（187（138–224）分钟vs 240（162–362）分钟，_P_ <.0001），延迟的术后不良事件发生率较低（15.4％vs 36％，_P_ = .007），包括尿流异常，肛门狭窄和矫正手术的发生率较低。两组之间的术中和即时不良事件发生率无差异。

### 结论

与阴道成形术相关的严重不良事件发生率低，而次要事件是常见的。在进行了50例阴道成形手术的阈值后，这些事件减少了，包括需要翻修手术。

**Adverse events associated with gender affirming vaginoplasty surgery.**

### Background

There is an abundance of reports on the surgical techniques for vaginoplasty surgery. However, careful review reveals a paucity of evidence-based data in addition to few reports on outcomes related to all of the varying techniques.

### Objective

This study aimed to describe the perioperative adverse events related to vaginoplasty surgery for transgender women and to determine a threshold case number needed to reduce adverse events.

### Study Design

This was a retrospective study of all women who underwent vaginoplasty surgery for gender affirmation at a tertiary care center. All cases were performed by a single board-certified female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery specialist. Women were included if 6-month outcomes were available. Once patients were identified, perioperative data were collected. Comparisons of adverse events and perioperative outcomes were made between varying threshold case numbers to determine the case number needed to significantly reduce adverse events. An a priori review of the literature was done to determine the incidence of commonly reported adverse events, and these incidences were used as a frame of reference to determine a threshold case number needed to replicate these reported incidence rates. Once this threshold was determined, outcomes were compared between cases performed before and after this threshold.

### Results

Between December 2015 and March 2019, 76 vaginoplasty surgeries were performed. Six-month outcomes data were available for all patients. Mean age and body mass index of all patients were 41 (±17) years and 27.3 (±5.1) kg/m2, respectively. Median (range) time on hormone therapy preceding surgery was 36 (12–360) months, and 7.9% (6) of patients had undergone previous orchiectomy. Of the patients, 83.4% (71) underwent full-depth vaginoplasty, whereas the remaining patients underwent a zero-depth procedure. Median (range) surgical time was 210 (138–362) minutes. Median (range) follow-up for all patients was 12.5 (6–50) months. The incidence of any intraoperative adverse event was 2.6% (95% confidence interval, 1.8–4.1) for all patients, whereas the incidence of any immediate (<30 days) and delayed (>30 days and <6 months) postoperative event was 19% (95% confidence interval, 16.4–22.2) and 25% (95% confidence interval, 22.4–28.4), respectively. Performance of 50 cases was identified to be a threshold that reduced adverse events in both clinically and statistically significant ways. Cases performed after the first 50 cases had lower surgical times (187 (138–224) vs 240 (162–362) minutes, _P_<.0001), a lower incidence of delayed postoperative adverse events (15.4% vs 36%, _P_\=.007), including a lower incidence of urinary stream abnormalities, introital stenosis, and the need for revision surgery. The incidence of intraoperative and immediate adverse events was not different between the groups.

### Conclusion

The incidence of serious adverse events related to vaginoplasty surgery is low, whereas minor events are common. After a threshold of 50 vaginoplasty surgeries, these events were reduced, including the need for revision surgery.
