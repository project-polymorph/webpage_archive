A movie made by high school students in Beijing has received mixed reactions from the public, as the show featuring the teenage LGBTQ community has unprecedentedly touched a taboo topic in China.

一部由北京高中生拍摄的电影《逃离》引起了公众很大的争议，该片反映的是青少年跨性别群体，在中国史无前例地触碰了这个禁忌话题。

Escape, a 75-minute movie, was jointly created by 37 students from the High School Affiliated to the prestigious Renmin University of China. Featuring the life of a transgender high schooler, the film has carried out an in-depth exploration into the LGBTQ community in Chinese schools, questioning the flaws of the country’s sexual education.

《逃离》时长75分钟，由人大附中37名学生一同拍摄完成。该片讲述了一个变形高中学生的生活，对中国学校里的跨性别群体进行了一次深入的探讨，对中国性教育的缺陷表达了质疑。

“Thanks to modern education, \[we’ve\] gained abundant knowledge about LGBTQ communities. But unfortunately, there are still many people in \[China\] who are not aware of the existence of such a minority group, while some are indifferent to, or even against them,” Hu Ranran, the movie’s director, told the Beijing Youth Daily during an interview.

在接受《北京青年报》采访时，该片导演胡然然表示：“由于现代教育，我们获取了关于跨性别群体的丰富知识。但是不幸的是，中国仍然有许多人没有意识到这样一个少数群体的存在，有些人漠不关心、甚至反对他们。”

The movie has been shown over the past few weeks among high school students in Beijing, with many supporting the team and praising the teenagers for “having a social responsibility that adults should have.”

过去几周该片已经面向北京高中学生上映了，许多人都表示支持该团队，并赞扬这样未成年人“拥有成年人的社会责任感”。

“My child is a transgender. I came here to watch the movie with her today, and I think it’s really good. It helps me understand the LGBTQ community and shows me some problems she may encounter in the future,” said a father who watched the show.

一名父亲观看该片之后说道：“我的孩子是变性人。我今天和她一起来看这部电影，我觉得这很好。这部电影让我了解了跨性别群体，告诉了我一些她将来可能遇到的问题。”

Despite the warm public praise, the film was not allowed to be presented at the school’s annual movie festival, as it contains “sensitive content.”

尽管受到了公众的热烈赞扬，但是这部电影却不允许在该校年度电影节上出现，因为包含了“敏感内容”。

“Our teachers said the show is too avant-garde, and is not suitable to be shown in public, while our parents, who regard LGBTQ as a taboo topic, are reluctant to talk about the movie with us,” said Hu.

胡然然说道：“我们老师说这部电影太前卫，不适合公映，而我们的父母都认为跨性别是一个禁忌的话题，不愿与我们谈论这部电影。”

Many of the students’ parents told Beijing Youth Daily that LGBTQ individuals are “mentally-distorted” and “abnormal,” with many suggesting mental therapy for the minority group.

许多学生的父母都对《北京青年报》表示称，跨性别群体里的人都是“精神扭曲”、“不正常”的人，建议这个群体的人接受心理治疗。

“I hope my movie can raise public concern over such a neglected group. I’ve contacted many LGBTQ individuals, who have overcome many difficulties, in an effort to become who they really are. Every one of us may become a member of a minority group in some aspects, and you should not be ashamed,” Hu added.

胡然然说道：“我希望这部电影能够引起公众对这个被忽视群体的关注。我接触过很多跨性别人士，他们为了成为真正的自己克服了许多困难。我们每个人都有可能成为某些方面的少数派， 不应该为此而感到羞愧。”
