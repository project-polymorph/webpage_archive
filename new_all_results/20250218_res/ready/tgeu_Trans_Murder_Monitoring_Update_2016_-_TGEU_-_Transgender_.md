# More Than 2,000 Trans People Killed in the Last 8 Years: Trans Murder Monitoring Update 2016

**Berlin, 31 March 2016**

On occasion of the International Transgender Day of Visibility (TDoV) held on the 31st of March every year, Transgender Europe (TGEU) publishes the **[Trans Murder Monitoring (TMM)](https://transrespect.org/en/research/tmm/) project update to join the voices raising awareness on this day about the multiple forms of discrimination faced by trans and gender-diverse people worldwide.**

This update (TMM TDoV 2016) reveals **2,016 reported killings of trans and gender-diverse people in 65 countries** worldwide between the 1st of January 2008 and the 31st of December 2015, more than 1,500 of which were reported in Central and South America. Further analysis of this data shows that **[65% of all murdered trans and gender-diverse people whose profession was known were sex workers](https://transrespect.org/en/tmm-trans-day-remembrance-2016/).**

Throughout all [six world regions](https://transrespect.org/en/tmm-trans-day-remembrance-2016/), the highest absolute numbers have been found in countries with strong trans movements and civil society organisations that carry out forms of professional monitoring: Brazil (802), Mexico (229), Colombia (105), Venezuela (98), and Honduras (79) in Central and South America; the United States (132) in North America; Turkey (41) and Italy (33) in Europe; and India (54), the Philippines (40) and Pakistan (34) in Asia.

The close connection between the existence of strong trans movements and professional monitoring on the one hand, and the highest absolute numbers of reports, on the other hand, point to the worrisome question of unreported cases.

TGEU’s Senior Researcher, Carsten Balzer/Carla LaGata, explains:

> “Beside the need for mechanisms to protect trans and gender diverse people, this connection also shows the need for trans and gender diverse organisations capable of professional monitoring and reporting of violence against their communities. This connection results in the fact that the figures show only the tip of the iceberg of homicides of trans and gender diverse people on a worldwide scale.”

While Brazil, Mexico, and the United States have the highest absolute numbers, the relative numbers show even more alarming results for some countries with smaller population sizes. Honduras, for instance, has a rate of 9.56 reported trans and gender diverse people killings per million inhabitants.

It is important to note that these cases are those that could be found through Internet search and cooperation with trans organisations and activists. In most countries, data on murdered trans and gender diverse people are not systematically produced, and it is impossible to estimate the numbers of unreported cases.
