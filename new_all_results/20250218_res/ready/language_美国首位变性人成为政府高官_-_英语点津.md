President Obama has named the first transgender woman to work as a Senior Technical Advisor to the Commerce Department, according to a new report.

Amanda Simpson had the operation to change from man to woman in the late 1990s while working at the missile firm Raytheon in Arizona.

She earned degrees in physics, engineering and business and is a certified flight instructor.

In a statement, Simpson, a member of the National Center for Transgender Equality's board of directors, said that "as one of the first transgender presidential appointees to the federal government, I hope that I will soon be one of hundreds, and that this appointment opens future opportunities for many others."

Simpson recently served as Deputy Director in Advanced Technology Development at Raytheon Missile Systems in Tucson, Ariz.

Amanda Simpson, who was born male and named Mitchell, was key in convincing the military contractor to add gender identity and expression to its equal employment opportunity policy.

She also ran for Congress and served as a delegate for then-Sen. Hillary Clinton to the Democratic National Convention in 2008.
