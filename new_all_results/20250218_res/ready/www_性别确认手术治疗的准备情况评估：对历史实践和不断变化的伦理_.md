跨性别者和性别多元化（TGD）是指性别认同与出生时分配的性别不同的个人。TGD个体可以选择对其性别表达进行各种修改，包括但不限于更改姓名、服装或发型、开始使用激素或接受手术。从1950年代开始，外科医生和内分泌学家开始用跨性别激素和各种统称为变性手术（SRS）的外科手术来治疗当时被称为变性症的疾病。不久之后，Harry Benjamin开始着手制定可以统一地应用于这些患者的护理标准。这些指南由世界跨性别健康专业协会（WPATH）发布，目前已进入第8版。在每次迭代中，都要求要求性别确认激素（GAH）或性别确认手术（GAS）的患者接受心理健康提供者的一次或多次详细评估，通过评估，他们必须获得“准备信”，将心理健康提供者置于守门人的角色。WPATH规定了性别确认治疗的资格标准和信件内容的一般指南，但没有包括必须包含的内容的具体细节，导致心理健康提供者在进行评估和写信的方式上缺乏统一性。本手稿旨在回顾随着时间的推移与成人GAS评估和准备信相关的实践，因为护理标准通过文献的范围审查而发展。我们将特别强调随着时间的推移改变道德考虑，以及护理模式从把关到知情同意的演变。为此，我们对文献进行了广泛的回顾。我们在指南的连续迭代中确定了一种趋势，即减少对TGD个体的耻辱感，并将伦理考虑从“不伤害”转变为患者自主的核心原则。这有助于减少护理的障碍，并将更多渴望护理的人与性别肯定护理（GAC）联系起来，但在这些作者看来，在减少障碍方面做得还不够。

**Readiness assessments for gender-affirming surgical treatments: A systematic scoping review of historical practices and changing ethical considerations**

Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) are terms that refer to individuals whose gender identity differs from sex assigned at birth. TGD individuals may choose any variety of modifications to their gender expression including, but not limited to changing their name, clothing, or hairstyle, starting hormones, or undergoing surgery. Starting in the 1950s, surgeons and endocrinologists began treating what was then known as transsexualism with cross-sex hormones and a variety of surgical procedures collectively known as sex reassignment surgery (SRS). Soon after, Harry Benjamin began work to develop standards of care that could be applied to these patients with some uniformity. These guidelines, published by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), are in their 8th iteration. Through each iteration, there has been a requirement that patients requesting gender-affirming hormones (GAH) or gender-affirming surgery (GAS) undergo one or more detailed evaluations by a mental health provider through which they must obtain a “letter of readiness,” placing mental health providers in the role of gatekeeper. WPATH specifies eligibility criteria for gender-affirming treatments and general guidelines for the content of letters, but does not include specific details about what must be included, leading to a lack of uniformity in how mental health providers approach performing evaluations and writing letters. This manuscript aims to review practices related to evaluations and letters of readiness for GAS in adults over time as the standards of care have evolved via a scoping review of the literature. We will place a particular emphasis on changing ethical considerations over time and the evolution of the model of care from gatekeeping to informed consent. To this end, we did an extensive review of the literature. We identified a trend across successive iterations of the guidelines in both reducing stigma against TGD individuals and shift in ethical considerations from “do no harm” to the core principle of patient autonomy. This has helped reduce barriers to care and connect more people who desire it to gender affirming care (GAC), but in these authors’ opinions does not go far enough in reducing barriers.
