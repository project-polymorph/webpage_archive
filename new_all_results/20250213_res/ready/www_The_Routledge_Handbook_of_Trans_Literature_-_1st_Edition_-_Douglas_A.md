## Critics' Reviews

> "The sheer depth and breadth of this hefty volume put the lie to prevalent contemporary misrepresentations of trans phenomena as both recent and primarily medical in nature. It spans centuries, genres, and themes to orient scholars and lay readers alike to a vast body of creative literary work by trans people or about trans topics."
> 
> **—Susan Stryker, Professor Emerita of Gender and Women’s Studies at the University of Arizona, author of _Transgender History_, and founding co-editor of _TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly_**
>
> "Committed equally to breadth, depth, and studied reflexivity, this book thoughtfully brings an impressive, motley array of voices; conceptual frameworks; urgent political and philosophical questions; and historical, cultural, and disciplinary contexts to bear on trans literature. Arriving at a moment when the stakes of any conflict over how “trans” will be read and represented could not be more clear, _The Routledge Handbook of Trans Literature_ will be valuable resource for writers, students, teachers, and readers of trans lit — anyone interested in cultivating the forms of life, thought, and creativity that “trans” has enabled and might yet."
> 
> **— Cameron Awkward-Rich, Associate Professor of Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and author of _The Terrible We: Thinking with Trans Maladjustment_**
>
> "_The Routledge Handbook of Trans Literature_ models a broad, deep, interdisciplinary understanding of trans literature that is self-critical about its categories, assumptions, and procedures; embraces a dynamic view of what “trans” and other relevant sex and gender categories have meant, can mean, and may mean in the future; and pushes the cultural, geographical, historical, biographical, categorical, formal, and conceptual boundaries of the literature we read as “trans.” As a whole and in its compelling parts, this collection will inspire and empower all readers, whatever their identification, to read from trans perspectives and through trans methodologies."
> 
> **— Joy Ladin, former David and Ruth Gottesman Chair in English at Yeshiva University and author of _Through the Door of Life: A Jewish Journey between Genders_** 
>
> "An essential guide to trans literature, in all its forms. The _Handbook_ looks at the achievements of past trans literature, offering a fresh perspective on key texts. While showing how politically vital literature is in a present that is becoming ever more transphobic, this volume also anticipates what future trans literature might look like, suggesting exciting ways it could evolve."
> 
> **— Juliet Jacques, Associate Lecturer on Contemporary Art Practice MA at the Royal College of Art and author of _Trans: A Memoir_**
>
> "This timely collection arrives at a fraught moment: one marked by both transphobic backlash and a remarkable “trans literary revolution,” to use Casey Plett’s phrase. The _Handbook_’s wide-ranging chapters and diverse contributors help us make sense of this moment—and of the pasts and possible futures of trans representation and liberation."
> 
> **— Nicole Seymour, Professor of English at California State University, Fullerton and author of _Strange Natures: Futurity, Empathy, and the Queer Ecological Imagination_**
>
> "What a rich, transhistorical, transcultural collection—as stimulating as it is field-forming. It's a foundational piece of scholarship that I can't wait to teach with and think with."
> 
> **— Kit Heyam, freelance writer, historian, trans awareness trainer, heritage practitioner and author of _Before We Were Trans: A New History of Gender_**
