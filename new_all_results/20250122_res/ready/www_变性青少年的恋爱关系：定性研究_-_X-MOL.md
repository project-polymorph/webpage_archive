## 背景：

身份的形成和人际关系的探索是青春期发生的重要任务。跨性别，性别多样化和性别不符合（TGNC）的个人必须在其跨性别认同的背景下面对这些发展里程碑。我们这篇文章的目的是描述青少年的历史和与浪漫伴侣的经历。

## 方法：

我们对跨性别青少年进行了现象学，定性的半结构化访谈。问题集中在浪漫的经历，思想和观念上。所有访谈均由研究团队的2名成员编码，分歧通过讨论解决，如有需要，还可与研究团队的3名成员解决。主题分析用于分析数据以及描述性分类。

## 结果：

总共采访了15至20岁的30名青少年（18位男性男性和12位女性女性）。主题包括（1）参与浪漫关系，（2）公开性别认同和浪漫关系，（3）虐待关系经历，以及（4）性别确认荷尔蒙护理对浪漫经历的影响。

## 结论：

TGNC青少年在社会和/或医学过渡之前和之中从事浪漫的经历，并通过近端同伴和在线联系来培养关系。可以肯定的是，在浪漫的经历中，性别认同的荷尔蒙护理是有益的。恋爱关系中的恐惧症风险影响跨性别青少年对恋爱的态度，并影响身份披露的决定。TGNC青少年有不同形式的恋爱经历。提供者可以在照顾TGNC青年时将这些发现纳入他们的咨询和筛查方法中。

**Romantic Relationships in Transgender Adolescents: A Qualitative Study**  

## BACKGROUND:

Identity formation and exploration of interpersonal relationships are important tasks that occur during adolescence. Transgender, gender diverse, and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) individuals must face these developmental milestones in the context of their transgender identity. Our aim with this article is to describe adolescents’ history and experiences with romantic partners.

## METHODS:

We conducted phenomenological, qualitative semistructured interviews with transgender adolescents. Questions were focused on romantic experiences, thoughts, and perceptions. All interviews were coded by 2 members of the research team, with disagreements resolved by discussion and, if needed, with a third member of the research team. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data, as well as descriptive categorization.

## RESULTS:

In total, 30 adolescents (18 transmasculine and 12 transfeminine) between the ages of 15 and 20 years were interviewed. Themes included (1) engagement in romantic relationships, (2) disclosure of gender identity and romantic relationships, (3) experience with abusive relationships, and (4) perceived impact of gender-affirming hormone care on romantic experiences.

## CONCLUSIONS:

TGNC adolescents are engaged in romantic experiences before and during social and/or medical transitioning and are cultivating relationships through both proximal peers and online connections. There is perceived benefit of gender-affirming hormone care on romantic experiences. Risk of transphobia in romantic relationships impacts the approach that transgender adolescents take toward romance and influences decisions of identity disclosure. TGNC adolescents have experience with relationship abuse in different forms. Providers can incorporate these findings in their approach to counseling and screening when caring for TGNC youth.
