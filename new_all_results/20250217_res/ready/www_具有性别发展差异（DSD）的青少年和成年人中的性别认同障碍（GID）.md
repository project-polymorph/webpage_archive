具有性发育差异（DSD）的天生婴儿的性别分配仍然是多学科治疗小组面临的许多困难决定之一，因为其中一些儿童成年后会出现性别认同障碍（GID）。在这项系统的回顾和荟萃分析中，我们分析了青少年和成年人DSD中GID的患病率。该评价的次要结果是帮助医生对DSD儿童进行适当的性别分配，以便减少以后生活中GID的发生。

### 方法

检索2005年至2020年之间发表的文章的“双性恋” \[所有领域\]或“性别分化障碍和“性别认同障碍或性别不安” \[MeSH\]。搜索的典型诊断为先天性肾上腺皮质增生（CAH）；完全雄激素不敏感综合症（CAIS）；部分雄激素不敏感综合征（PAIS）；5α还原酶缺乏症（5ARD）；17-羟类固醇脱氢酶缺乏症（17HSD）；混合性腺发育不良（MGD）和完全性腺发育不良（CGD）。提取年龄在12岁以上的DSD患者中的GID或性别烦躁不安（强烈的对自己作为男性或女性的不满情绪）。在每种条件下，比较雌性和雄性饲养的GID百分比。

### 结果

DSD中GID患病率的I2统计数据显示出高度异质性，其中包括的20篇文章中I2为93％（95％CI为90–95％）。在DSD患者中，GID的总体患病率为15％（95％CI为13-17％）。饲养CAH的雌性的GID为4％，而饲养CAH的雄性的GID为15％（p = 0.0056）。所有CAIS患者均以女性长大，GID的患病率为1.7％。女性的PAIS的GID患病率为12％，而男性的GID患病率为25％，无显着性差异（p = 0.134）。雌性饲养的5ARD（53％）和17HSD（53％）的GID显着较高，其中一半在青春期就已致死，迫使其改变性别。在性染色体DSD中，以女性饲养的有22％的人患有GID，而以男性饲养的则没有任何差异。

### 结论

在患有CAH，CAIS和CGD的女性中，GID较低，有利于在这些情况下进行雌性饲养。在这些情况下，5ARD / 17HSD的女性中GID较高，而男性则更倾向于男性。GID在PAIS或MGD中是可变的，在这些情况下无法提出有关饲养性别的建议。每位DSD患者都是独一无二的，他们需要多学科的护理和长期的心理性支持。

**Gender identity disorder (GID) in adolescents and adults with differences of sex development (DSD): A systematic review and meta-analysis**

Gender assignment in infants born with a difference in sexual development (DSD) remains one of the many difficult decisions faced by the multi-disciplinary treatment team as some of these children develop gender identity disorder (GID) when they become adults. In this systematic review and meta-analysis we have analyzed the prevalence of GID in adolescent and adults with DSD. The secondary outcome of this review is to help physicians in appropriate sex assignment of DSD children so that development of GID in later life can be reduced.

### Methods

Pubmed/Index medicus were searched for “intersex” \[All fields\] OR “disorders of sexual differentiation AND “gender identity disorder OR gender dysphoria” \[MeSH\] for articles published between 2005 and 2020. Typical diagnoses included were congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH); complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS); partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS); 5 alpha reductase deficiency (5ARD); 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency (17HSD); mixed gonadal dysgenesis (MGD) and complete gonadal dysgenesis (CGD). GID or gender dysphoria (a strong feeling of dissatisfaction about oneself as male or female) prevalence in DSD patients older than 12 years of age was extracted. Within each condition, GID percentage was compared between female and male rearing.

### Results

The I2statistics for prevalence of GID in DSD showed high heterogeneity with I2 of 93% (95% C.I 90–95%) among the 20 articles included. The overall prevalence of GID among those with DSD was 15% (95% C.I 13–17%). CAH reared females had 4% GID while CAH reared males had significantly higher GID at 15% (p = 0.0056). All CAIS patients were raised as females and the prevalence of GID was 1.7%. GID prevalence was 12% in PAIS raised as females while 25% in those raised as males with no significant difference (p = 0.134). GID was significantly high in 5ARD (53%) and 17HSD (53%) reared as females with half of them virilizing at puberty forcing a gender change. Among sex chromosome DSD 22% of those reared as females had GID while none in those raised as male with no significant difference.

### Conclusions

GID is low in women with CAH, CAIS and CGD favoring female sex of rearing in these conditions. GID is high in women with 5ARD/17HSD favoring male sex of rearing in these conditions. GID is variable in PAIS or MGD and no recommendations on sex of rearing could be made in these conditions. Each DSD patient is unique and they warrant multi-disciplinary care and long term psycho sexual support.
