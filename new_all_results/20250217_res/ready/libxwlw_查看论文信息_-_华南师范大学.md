跨性别者（Trans/Transgender）是一个集合名词，指性别认同或性别表达与其出生时被指派的性别不一致的个体。跨性别的现象从古到今在很多文化中均有出现过，但作为一个被高度污名化的群体，跨性别者在很多文化中都被认为是病态的、不道德的，他们也因此面对着种种形式的歧视和暴力。来自各国的调查研究均表明，跨性别群体抑郁、焦虑患病率很高，同时还存在着极高的自杀率，其心理健康状态不容乐观，应给予重视。然而目前，我国以跨性别群体为对象的心理学研究还比较有限。

本研究以跨性别群体的歧视知觉为研究起点，探索内化跨性别嫌恶和社会支持在跨性别群体的歧视知觉和心理健康中的作用机制。本研究包含两个部分，在研究一中，通过网络抽样的方式，征集了146名跨性别被试，通过翻译—回译的方式修订了内化跨性别嫌恶量表；在研究二中，在全国范围内抽取了321名跨性别者作为研究对象采用跨性别歧视知觉量表、修订后的内化跨性别嫌恶量表、社会支持评定量表(SSRS)、流调中心抑郁量表（CES-D13）、Campbell幸福感指数量表以及焦虑自评量表(SAS)等测量工具对跨性别者的歧视知觉、社会支持、内化跨性别嫌恶以及心理健康的两个消极指标（抑郁、焦虑）和一个积极指标（主观幸福感）进行测量，最后运用结构方程模型建模的方法考察了社会支持和内化跨性别嫌恶在歧视知觉和心理健康之间的多重中介作用。研究通过详细的分析和考察，得出以下结论：

（1）我国跨性别群体不同群体间知觉歧视水平差异显著：跨性别女性的歧视知觉水平显著的高于其他跨性别群体；低年龄组的跨性别者歧视知觉水平显著高于高年龄组。

（2）不同自我认同的跨性别群体内化跨性别嫌恶水平差异显著，跨性别男性和跨性别女性的内化跨性别嫌恶水平著高于其他两个跨性别群体；处于亲密关系中的跨性别者与未处于亲密关系中的跨性别者内化嫌恶水平差异显著，不同出柜状态的跨性别者的内化跨性别嫌恶的水平差异显著。

（3）我国跨性别群体的社会支持水平处于中等偏低水平，且社会支持水平在不同受教育程度、亲密关系状态和出柜状态上有显著差异。

（4）我国跨性别群体的总体心理健康水平偏低，主要表现为抑郁、焦虑水平偏高，主观幸福感水平中等。不同年龄的跨性别群体在心理健康的各项指标方面均差异显著。

（5）跨性别群体的知觉歧视水平与心理健康的消极指标（抑郁、焦虑）呈显著正相关、与心理健康的积极指标呈显著负相关；歧视知觉水平与社会支持呈显著负相关、与内化跨性别嫌恶呈显著正相关。

（6）社会支持与内化嫌恶均在歧视知觉与心理健康的关系中起到部分中介作用。

Trans/Transgender is an umbrella term that refers to a gender identity or gender expression that is different from the person assigned to the gender at birth. The phenomenon of transgender has been seen in many cultures since ancient times. However, as a highly stigmatized group the transgender group, trans people are considered to be morbid and immoral in many cultures, so they are generally subjected to discrimination and violence,because they are challenging the social norm of gender binary, Studies from various countries have shown that transgender people is suffering from many kinds of psychological distress. At present, there is no psychological research on Chinese transgender.

This study explores the link between trans people’s perceived discrimination and mental health, and the mechanisms of both internalized transnegativety and social support in the relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health of transgender groups. Through the network sampling method, 321 transgender people joint the survey and completed the research. In Study 1, the author revised Internalized Transnegativety Scale. In study 2, the perceived discrimination Scale, the revised Internalized Transnegativety Scale, and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) were used to measure the three variables, the Center of Depression Depression Scale (CES-D13) and the Campbell Happiness Index and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were used to measure two negative indicators health (depression, anxiety) and a positive indicator (subjective well-being) of mental health.

This study found through structural equation models (SEM) that both social support and internalized transnegativity play the mediation role in the relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health Through detailed analysis and investigation, the study draws the following conclusions:

 (1) The level of perceived discrimination in transgender groups in China is generally low, and the differences among different groups are significant: the level of discriminatory perception of trans-women is significantly higher than that of other transgender groups; the level of perceived discrimination is higher in younger transgender.

 (2) The internalized transnegativety of transgender groups in China is at a medium level, and the transgender males and transgender women have higher levels of internalized transnegativety than the other two transgender groups; The level of internalized transnegativety in trans people with intimate relationships of transgender people who are not in intimate relationship is significantly different, and the level of internalized transnegativety of transgender people in different coming out status is significantly different.

(3) The level of social support level of transgender groups in China is relatively low, and the level of social support is significantly different in different levels of education, intimacy, and status.

(4) The overall mental health level of transgender groups in China is relatively low, mainly due to high levels of depression and anxiety, and moderate levels of subjective well-being. Transgender groups of different ages have significant differences in mental health indicators.

(5) The level of perceived discrimination of transgender groups was significantly positively correlated with the negative indicators of mental health (depression, anxiety), and negatively correlated with the positive indicators of mental health; the level of perceived discrimination was significantly negatively correlated with social support and positively correlated with internalized transnegativety

 (6) Both social support and internalized transnegativety have played the mediating role in the relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health.
