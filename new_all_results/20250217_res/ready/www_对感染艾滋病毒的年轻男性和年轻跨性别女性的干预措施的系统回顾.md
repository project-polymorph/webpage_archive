男男性行为者 (YMSM) 和年轻变性女性 (YTGW) 在艾滋病毒护理方面面临着独特的挑战。我们进行了系统回顾，总结了专门针对 YMSM 和 YTGW 艾滋病毒感染者的行为和结构干预措施。我们从六个数据库中筛选了截至 2022 年 8 月 19 日发布的 6546 条记录。为了符合资格，研究需要涉及专门针对 YMSM 和/或 YTGW 艾滋病毒感染者的结构或行为干预措施，或提供该群体的分类数据。使用 ICROMS 检查表进行质量评估。该评价纳入了来自 18 项干预措施的 20 项研究。干预措施的特征存在相当大的异质性，包括人口、地点、干预措施的内容和形式以及目标结果。一半的干预措施被描述为试点研究，除一项研究外，所有研究都是在美国进行的。最常见的结果包括艾滋病毒护理连续性，其次是艾滋病毒知识和自我效能、艾滋病毒风险行为和心理健康。证据基础仍然稀疏，有效性结果不一致，一些干预措施报告参与者接受治疗后的结果有所改善，而其他干预措施则没有报告任何有意义的变化。尽管针对这一群体的干预措施的制定取得了一些进展，但我们强调了未来研究的几个方向。有必要将干预措施扩展到资源匮乏地区、解决结构性障碍并针对参与者健康的不同方面。为了增加证据的强度，有必要进行更大样本量、更长时间跟踪参与者的严格研究。

**A Systematic Review of Interventions for Young Men Who Have Sex With Men and Young Transgender Women Living with HIV**

Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women (YTGW) have unique challenges to HIV care. We conducted a systematic review to summarize behavioral and structural interventions exclusively targeting YMSM and YTGW living with HIV. We screened 6546 records published through August 19th, 2022 from six databases. For eligibility, studies needed to involve structural or behavioral interventions exclusively targeting YMSM and/or YTGW living with HIV or presenting disaggregated data in this group. Quality assessment was performed using the ICROMS checklist. Twenty studies from 18 interventions were included in the review. There was considerable heterogeneity in intervention characteristics, including population, location, content and format of the interventions and targeted outcomes. Half of the interventions were described as pilot studies, and all but one study was conducted in the United States. The most common outcomes included the HIV care continuum, followed by HIV knowledge and self-efficacy, HIV-risk behaviors and mental health. The evidence base remained sparse, and the results on effectiveness were inconsistent, with some interventions reporting improved outcomes among participants after receiving treatment and others not reporting any meaningful changes. Although there has been some progress in the development of interventions targeting this group, we highlighted several directions for future research. Interventions expanding to low-resource settings, addressing structural barriers, and targeting different aspects of health among participants are warranted. Rigorous studies with larger sample sizes that follow participants over longer periods are necessary to increase the strength of the evidence.
