**流动性别**（Genderfluid），又称**流性别/Gender-fluid，性别流动/Gender Fluid，或流体性别/Fluid Gender**，是一个位于[多性别](/wiki/Multigender "Multigender")，[非二元性别](/wiki/Nonbinary "Nonbinary")，以及[跨性别](/wiki/Transgender "Transgender")伞下的性别身份。流动性别的个体在不同时间有不同的[性别身份](/wiki/Gender_identity "Gender identity")。一个流动性别个体的性别认同可以一时存在多个，然后切换成完全没有性别认同，或者在单个的性别认同间移动，或者是其中其它的一些组合。对于某些流动性别的人来说，这些变化频繁到会一天发生多次，而对于其它人，变化是数以月计的，或者更不频繁。一些流动性别的人会只在少数几个特定的性别间移动，可能少到只有两个性别（这样也适用于[双性别](/wiki/Bigender "Bigender")的标签），然而其它流动性别的人从来不会知道TA们接下来会体验到什么性别。

To be easy to read, this article uses the word "genderfluid" for all people who experience fluid gender. Some people who experience fluid gender don't use the word "genderfluid" for themselves. Some people with fluid genders use other labels such as [genderqueer](/wiki/Genderqueer "Genderqueer"), [bigender](/wiki/Bigender "Bigender"), [multigender](/wiki/Multigender "Multigender"), [genderfae](/wiki/Genderfae "Genderfae"), [polygender](/wiki/Polygender "Polygender"), etc. It's important to understand that each person has the right to decide what to call their gender identity.

## History

Kate Bornstein mentioned gender fluidity in 1994, in the book _Gender Outlaw: On Men, Women and the Rest of Us_, "and then I found that gender can have fluidity, which is quite different from ambiguity. If ambiguity is a refusal to fall within a prescribed gender code, then fluidity is the refusal to remain one gender or another. Gender fluidity is the ability to freely and knowingly become one or many of a limitless number of genders, for any length of time, at any rate of change. Gender fluidity recognizes no borders or rules of gender."[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)

The word "genderfluid" has been in use since at least the 1990s, albeit with a somewhat different meaning. Transgender advocate Michael M. Hernandez wrote in 1996:

«

Gender-fluid means that their gender identity and/or expression encompass both [masculine](/wiki/Masculine "Masculine") and [feminine](/wiki/Feminine "Feminine"). Gender fluidity is becoming commonly known as transgenderism: the ability to transcend gender, whether biological, emotional, political, or otherwise; truly mixing male and female.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)

»

In the 1990s and 2000s, it might have been more common for genderfluid people to call themselves [bigender](/wiki/Bigender "Bigender") or [genderqueer](/wiki/Genderqueer "Genderqueer"). Earlier than that, they may have called themselves [cross-dressers](/wiki/Cross-dresser "Cross-dresser").

The earliest extant entry for "gender fluid" in the Urban Dictionary was added in 2007.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4) 

In 2010, the [Gender-Fluid community](http://web.archive.org/web/20161013063943/http://gender-fluid.livejournal.com/) was created on LiveJournal.[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)

In 2012, JJ Poole (tumblr user thoughtstoberemembered) created what would become the most widely-used genderfluid flag.[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)

In 2014, "Gender Fluid" was one of the 56 genders made available on Facebook.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

In 2015, Dictionary.com added an entry for "gender-fluid,"[\[9\]](#cite_note-9) which it defined as an adjective meaning "noting or relating to a person whose gender identity or gender expression is not fixed and shifts over time or depending on the situation." It listed as synonyms genderfluid, gender fluid, and gender-flexible.[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

In 2018, Washington state began to allow "X" gender markers on official documents[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackman-11), with the law stating that

«

"X" means a gender that is not exclusively male or female, including, but not limited to, intersex, [agender](/wiki/Agender "Agender"), [amalgagender](/wiki/Amalgagender "Amalgagender"), [androgynous](/wiki/Androgynous "Androgynous"), [bigender](/wiki/Bigender "Bigender"), [demigender](/wiki/Demigender "Demigender"), female-to-male, [genderfluid](/wiki/Genderfluid "Genderfluid"), [genderqueer](/wiki/Genderqueer "Genderqueer"), male-to-female, [neutrois](/wiki/Neutrois "Neutrois"), [nonbinary](/wiki/Nonbinary "Nonbinary"), [pangender](/wiki/Pangender "Pangender"), [third sex](/wiki/Third_gender "Third gender"), [transgender](/wiki/Transgender "Transgender"), [transsexual](/wiki/Transsexual "Transsexual"), [Two Spirit](/wiki/Two_Spirit "Two Spirit"), and unspecified.[\[12\]](#cite_note-washington-12)

## 影响性别流动性的因素

«

_Sometimes, when I'm feeling a certain way, like if I'm currently masculine, I wonder to myself, "What if I don't change from this? What if I'm not genderfluid and just a transboy?" But I always change again, and it's cool and weird. I guess I just have mixed feelings about it. Is it a good or bad thing? I don't know._

»

— _Starling (流动性别)_[\[1\]](#cite_note-story-quote-1)

Usually, gender fluidity happens by itself, so that a person feels like, say, a girl at a certain time, rather than choosing to be a girl at a certain time.[\[13\]](#cite_note-:1-13) Some genderfluid people find that no outside or inside things tend to influence their gender identity to change. They find that their gender fluidity is unpredictable and happens randomly. Other genderfluid people find that their gender changes depending on the situation and is influenced by inside or outside sources. Some move from one gender to the next on a regular cycle, resembling a lunar cycle, or synchronizing with their menstrual cycle. Other genderfluid people are sometimes able to use their willpower to guide their gender to change in a way and/or at the time that they want it to.

#### Menstrual cycle and its effect on gender fluidity

While it is still unclear, changes in gender that correlate with the menstrual cycle could be caused by how hormone levels naturally rise and fall during menstruation. However, it's also possible to mistakenly believe that gender identity moves with the menstrual cycle, and the only way to be sure is to keep a daily journal. Such a journal could look like this:

| 日期       | 当天的性别认同           | 在月经周期中的日期 |
|-----------|-----------------------|---------------|
| 2013-03-09 | 男性（全天）            | 14            |
| 2013-03-10 | 男性，然后变为女性       | 15            |

After enough data is collected, any patterns that exist should become visible. These patterns could include feeling like a certain gender during a certain day in the cycle or feeling like a certain gender at times when a certain hormone, such as estrogen, is highest/lowest. Similar tables can be used to track if gender identity is connected to a different cycle.

In 2012, Case and Ramachandran gave a report on the results of a survey of genderfluid people who call themselves [bigender](/wiki/Bigender "Bigender") who experience involuntary alternation between [female](/wiki/Female "Female") and [male](/wiki/Male "Male") states. Case and Ramachandran gave this condition the name "Alternating gender incongruity (AGI)." Case and Ramachandran made the hypothesis that gender alternation may reflect an unusual degree (or depth) of hemispheric switching and the corresponding suppression of sex appropriate body maps in the parietal cortex. They "hypothesize\[d\] that tracking the nasal cycle, rate of binocular rivalry, and other markers of hemispheric switching will reveal a physiological basis for AGI individuals' subjective reports of gender switches... We base our hypotheses on ancient and modern associations between the left and right hemispheres and the male and female genders."[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)[\[16\]](#cite_note-16) Case and Ramachandran believe that when bigender people feel a change between their gender identities, it may have to do with a change in how they use parts of their brains. The gender change might also have to do with a natural body cycle, specifically, a valve in the nose that changes sides every two days (the nasal cycle). However, this idea is still only a hypothesis, and more study is needed to confirm it.

## Gender expression

Genderfluid people often feel a need to change their [gender expression](/wiki/Gender_expression "Gender expression") to match whatever their current gender has become. This may mean having groups of different kinds of [clothing](/wiki/Clothing "Clothing") in their closet, so they can dress as a woman, man, or otherwise, depending on how they feel that day. It can also mean temporarily changing their body shape by using [binding](/wiki/Binding "Binding"), packing, breast prostheses, or tucking. However, in some situations, changing gender expression isn't possible. This could be because the changes happen more than once a day, because they don't look [androgynous](/wiki/Androgyny "Androgyny"), or because they don't feel safe in society if they were to present a certain way.

Genderfluid people don't necessarily look androgynous. They don't necessarily have an ambiguous face, body, or way of dress.

[Gender dysphoria](/wiki/Gender_dysphoria "Gender dysphoria"), or feeling painfully uncomfortable about how one's body and social role don't match one's gender, isn't a requirement in order to be genderfluid. Each person is different, experiencing gender fluidity in their own way. Some genderfluid people experience [gender dysphoria](/wiki/Gender_dysphoria "Gender dysphoria") at times or all the time. Some want to change their bodies and some take a physical [transition](/wiki/Transition "Transition") to do so, which may include hormones  or [surgery](/wiki/Surgery "Surgery"). Others don't choose to transition because any change they make to their body would only feel right to them when they were in a certain gender and would feel wrong in others. Yet others have a difficult time planning their transition path, because their feelings change about what they want.[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)[\[18\]](#cite_note-:2-18)

Some genderfluid people ask to be called by a different [name](/wiki/Names "Names")[\[18\]](#cite_note-:2-18) and [pronouns](/wiki/Pronouns "Pronouns") depending on what gender they feel at a certain time. For people who switch between only two genders, this can mean switching between two names. These may be feminine and masculine versions of the same name[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)或 names that don't sound similar at all.[\[20\]](#cite_note-:3-20) They may also take a gender-neutral name that works for them at any time, either in addition to these names, or instead of them.

## Gender fluidity and dissociative identity disorder

Genderfluid people usually don't think of themselves as having alters. Most genderfluid people feel like the same person all the time, with the same likes and dislikes but a different gender. However, some genderfluid people switch between specific personas as they change genders, and each persona has their own likes and dislikes. This is different from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), which is a disorder characterized by dissociation and the existence of alters. DID is frequently caused by traumatic abuse that happens early in childhood and almost always exists alongside PTSD or cPTSD. Gender fluidity is not caused by abuse and is not more common in people with PTSD or cPTSD.

Multiple/plural systems where some alters have different genders from the others are not automatically genderfluid. However, an individual alter can be genderfluid.

_See main article: [Nonbinary gender in fiction](/wiki/Nonbinary_gender_in_fiction#Nonbinary_genders_in_fiction "Nonbinary gender in fiction")_

There are many more [nonbinary characters in fiction who have a gender identity outside of the binary](/wiki/Nonbinary_gender_in_fiction#Nonbinary_genders_in_fiction "Nonbinary gender in fiction"). The following are only some of those characters who are specifically called by the words "genderfluid" or "fluid gender", either in their canon, or by their creators. At the very least, characters in this section should be known to present different gender expressions at different times, if the word "genderfluid" isn't used.

- Brendan Chase. At the end of the novel, _Freakboy_, the main character, Brendan Chase identifies themselves as genderfluid. The book is primarily about their transition, and does end on a depressing note regarding their gender.

- Alex Fierro, in Rick Riordan's _Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard_, is a genderfluid character who first appears in the second book and uses both he/him and she/her pronouns.

- Tedd. _[El Goonish Shive](http://www.egscomics.com/)_ includes a main character who identifies as genderfluid several years into the comic. Author Dan Shive has said that Tedd, like the author, has always been genderfluid but did not realise there was a word for it or even a concept of being nonbinary until much later in life. The comic also includes various other LGBT characters as well as shapeshifting technology.

- Kami / Porcelain. The 'New 52' version of [Secret Six](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Six_\(comics\)#New_52) introduces new character Kami / Porcelain, who is genderfluid and has been shown presenting as male, female and androgynously.

- _[Tattoo'd](https://tapastic.com/episode/212183)_ by Antonia Bea features an [intersex](/wiki/Intersex "Intersex"), genderfluid protagonist.

- TOMCAT. In the video game _Read Only Memories_ the character TOMCAT uses they/them pronouns. While it is not directly stated in-game that TOMCAT is nonbinary, artist and director John James has stated in an interview that TOMCAT "is gender fluid"[\[49\]](#cite_note-49).The game also includes other nonbinary characters, including the robot Turing and the protagonist if the player chooses so.

- _Symptoms of Being Human_ stars Riley Cavanaugh, a closeted genderfluid teenager. Note: the book has some possibly triggering subjects, including child abuse, transphobic violence, bullying, and suicidal thoughts.[\[50\]](#cite_note-supe_Symp-50)

- In _The Tiger's Watch_ by Julia Ember, the protagonist Tashi is genderfluid and uses [singular they](/wiki/Singular_they "Singular they") pronouns. The author notes that "Being [misgendered](/wiki/Misgendering "Misgendering") and forced to change their appearance in order to hide is a source of conflict in the novel. It is not the central plot conflict, though."[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)

- Sal in _Mask of Shadows_ and _Ruin of Stars_, by Linsey Miller, is genderfluid.

- Recurring character Puck/Owen Burnett in the 1994-1997 Disney show _Gargoyles_ was confirmed to be genderfluid and [polysexual](/wiki/Polysexual "Polysexual") by a 2014 interview with the creative team.[\[52\]](#cite_note-insider-database-52)
