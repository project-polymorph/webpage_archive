## Breaking down barriers that divide us

We are more powerful together than apart, and we’ve never been more energized or more focused. Our work centers on three pillars of action to end discrimination and fight for change at every level — and for every single one of us.

### Equality Magazine: Fall 2024

### [Hope](https://www.hrc.org/magazine)

The 2024 election featured some devastating setbacks for people who believe in progressive ideals and full equality for the LGBTQ+ community. But amid that darkness, there are some bright lights of hope. Sarah McBride is one of the trailblazers who is living proof that progress cannot be stopped. As the LGBTQ+ community grows, we will continue to elect diverse LGBTQ+ members of Congress so that every American can see themselves represented in our government. This sends a message to the queer and trans youth who have been under unprecedented attack over the past few years that a successful future where they have a seat at the table is possible.
