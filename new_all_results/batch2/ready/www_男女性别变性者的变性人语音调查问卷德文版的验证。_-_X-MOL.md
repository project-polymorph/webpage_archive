目的这项研究的目的是研究男性对女性变性者的变性语音问卷（TVQMtF）的德语翻译的心理计量学特性，该问卷评估了变性女性与语音相关的生活质量（VrQoL）。研究设计这是一项横断面研究。方法进行的在线调查包括TVQMtF以及对VrQoL（语音障碍指数）和过渡项目的常规测量。分析了127名跨性别女性的数据，计算了信度和收敛效度的系数。此外，进行了验证性因素分析和模型修改。结果分析显示出极好的内部一致性（α= 0.97），对半可靠性（rSB = 0.95）和良好的收敛效度。发现德国TVQMtF的总分与语音障碍指数（r = 0.88; P <0.001）和声音自我感知（r = -0.57; P <0.001）之间存在显着关联。找到了一个具有两因素结构的可接受模型，其中包括30个项目中的22个。结论TVQMtF是德国首个可靠，有效的跨性别女性VrQoL测量方法。因此，可以推荐将其用于语音治疗和外科手术的临床和研究目的。

**Validation of the German Version of the Transsexual Voice Questionnaire for Male-to-Female Transsexuals.** OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the German translation of the Transsexual Voice Questionnaire for Male-to-Female Transsexuals (TVQMtF), an instrument assessing the voice-related quality of life (VrQoL) in trans women. STUDY DESIGN This is a cross-sectional study. METHOD The conducted online survey contained the TVQMtF as well as a generic measurement of VrQoL (Voice Handicap Index) and items on transition. Data of 127 trans women were analyzed computing coefficients of reliability and convergent validity. Additionally, confirmatory factor analysis and model modification were performed. RESULTS Analyses revealed excellent internal consistency (α = 0.97), split-half reliability (rSB = 0.95) and good convergent validity. Significant associations were found between the total scores of the German TVQMtF and the Voice Handicap Index (r = 0.88; P < 0.001) as well as the vocal self-perception (r = -0.57; P < 0.001). An acceptable model with a two-factor structure including 22 of the 30 items was found. CONCLUSIONS The TVQMtF is the first German reliable and valid measurement of VrQoL for trans women. Therefore, its utilization can be recommended for clinical and research purposes in the fields of voice therapy and surgery.
