It can be tough to know what resource you need when you aren’t sure how you’re feeling. The following prompts can be used to check in with yourself & determine which methods of self-care might be beneficial. These prompts can be used at any time to help identify where you might direct your self-care.

-   How are you really feeling today? What’s one small thing you could do that would help you feel better?
-   How do you know when you need to take a break?
-   When you need a break, do you prefer to spend time alone or with others?
-   How can you prioritize your basic needs first (drinking water, nourishing your body, getting enough sleep)?

If you’d like to take a mental health screening, check out the two below:
