一些报告显示了跨性别人群生活质量 (QoL) 的不同结果。因此，本研究的目的是对变性手术后个体的生活质量（QoL）进行系统回顾和荟萃分析。我们检索了主要生物医学电子数据库，包括 Scopus、Google Scholar、心理信息数据库 (PsycInfo)、Web of Science、PubMed、Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE) 和 ProQuest，查找截至 2019 年 12 月发表的所有英文相关文献。论文必须是横断面研究，报告变性人手术后的生活质量。选择符合条件的研究后，两位作者独立提取每项研究的数据，并与第三位评审员协商一致解决任何不一致的问题。偏倚风险由 2 位独立研究专家根据纽卡斯尔-渥太华量表 (NOS) 进行评估。在这项研究中，从初步调查中提取的 497 篇文章中，最终选择了 8 篇涉及 1099 名患者的文章进行荟萃分析。根据世界卫生组织生活质量 (WHOQoL-BREF) 和 36 年的研究，变性人的生活质量汇总平均值分别为 70.45 (95% CI 55.87–85.03) 和 59.17 (95% CI 48.59–69.74)。 - 医疗结果研究调查问卷 (SF36) 的项目简表。此外，对男性对女性和女性对男性的加权平均生活质量进行亚组分析的结果显示，女性对男性的平均生活质量为57.54（95%CI 42.24-72.84），而女性对男性的平均生活质量为62.47（95%CI）。根据 SF36 调查问卷，男性与女性的 %CI 45.94–79.00）。此外，女性与男性的加权平均生活质量分别为 69.99 (95% CI 43.76, 96.23) 和 70。根据 WHOQoL-BREF 问卷，男性与女性之间的差异为 65 (95%CI 53.11, 88.19)。这项系统评价的结果可能支持促进性别重新分配的变性方法。在本综述中，由于初步研究数量不足，没有将手术后的生活质量与手术前甚至激素治疗前的生活质量进行比较。

**Quality of life in people with transsexuality after surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.** Several reports have demonstrated varying results on the quality of life (QoL) of the transgender population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis about the quality of life (QoL) of individuals during the post transsexual surgery period. We searched major biomedical electronic databases, including Scopus, Google Scholar, Psychological Information Database (PsycInfo), Web of Science, PubMed, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), and ProQuest, for all relevant literature published in English up to December 2019. The included papers required to be cross sectional studies that reported quality of life in people with transsexuality post surgery. After selecting eligible studies, 2 authors extracted data of each study independently and resolved any inconsistency by consensus with the third reviewer. The risk of bias was assessed by 2 independent research experts by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). In this study, out of 497 articles extracted from the initial investigation, 8 articles with 1099 patients were ultimately selected for meta-analysis. The pooled mean of quality of life in transsexual individuals was obtained to be 70.45 (95%CI 55.87–85.03) and 59.17 (95%CI 48.59–69.74), based on World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQoL-BREF) and The 36-item short form of the Medical Outcomes Study questionnaire (SF36), respectively. Also, the results of the subgroup analysis for the weighted mean quality of life in male to female and female to male showed that the mean quality of life in female to male was 57.54 (95%CI 42.24–72.84) and it was 62.47 (95%CI 45.94–79.00) in male to female, based on SF36 questionnaire. Moreover, the weighted mean quality of life in female to male was 69.99 (95%CI 43.76, 96.23) and it was 70.65 (95%CI 53.11, 88.19) in male to female, based on WHOQoL-BREF questionnaire. The results of this systematic review may support the approaches to transsexuality that facilitates sex reassignment. In this review, the means of quality of life after surgery were not compared to the means of quality of life before surgery or even before hormonal therapy which was due to inadequate number of primary studies.
